Now we have planned to sensitize boys in colleges and academic institutions to behave well. We will form teams and talk to them about women safety.

He said that women should come up and make complain if they face any problem. \"The women should display courage and make complaint. Once a complaint is received, police will actively pursue the matter. Their courage will deter the accused and inspire others to raise voice,\" he said. Kumar urged people in the gathering to dial women helpline 1090 immediately if they face any problem. He also urged parents not to discriminate among the girls and boys in their upbringing at home. The SSP said that some people have pre-conceived notion that the police personnel are unfriendly, which is not true. \"The city police are very sensitive towards peoples safety. We take all complaints seriously and take actions accordingly,\" he said.

The NHRC has asked its DIG Investigation to depute a team, headed by an officer of the rank of senior superintendent of police, to investigate and submit a report within two weeks. It has observed that the objective of a juvenile home is to guide youngsters, found involved in criminal activities, in the right direction for introspection and improvement. \"The scenario emerging out of the news report indicates that the Noida juvenile home, instead of guiding the juveniles to become better citizens, is pushing them towards crime-oriented activities by treating them in grossly negligent and cruel manner,\" the NHRC said in a statement. \"It is further observed that it is the duty of the state to take care of its citizens, especially, belonging to vulnerable classes like juveniles, when they are under its custody. The management of the home is not only subjecting the young juveniles to harassment but also inciting them to become accustomed criminals.

The Noida district magistrate has already ordered an investigation. The state of affairs inside the home came to light after a district legal services authority (DLSA) inspection on October 7 this year. The report pointed to an extortion racket being run by older inmates of the home that made inmates pay for spending time with family members on scheduled visit days.

Aarushi and Hemraj were killed in the Talwars Jalvayu Vihar house in Noida, just eight days before Aarushi was to turn 14. Initially Hemraj, the familys domestic help who was missing, was suspected to be the killer but a day later his partially decomposed body was found on the terrace of the house. A special CBI court had in November 2013 convicted the dentist couple for the murders and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The HC bench, however, found no \"irresistible conclusion\" leading to the guilt of the Talwars and upheld their appeal against their conviction. \"Neither the evidence on record nor the circumstances can establish a chain showing involvement of the accused in this murder case,\" the bench said, ending a nine year ordeal for the parents.

CoworkIn already has a facility in Sector 125 since September with 600 seats, their smaller facilities with 50 and 100 seats are expected to open in January. Co-working involves a shared workplace, often an office, and independent activity. Unlike in a typical office, those coworking are not employed by the same firm. While co-working spaces are expanding widely in Gurgaon as well, the Noida market, which is just emerging, is by far cheaper for end-users. Gurgaon seats are by far more expensive than Noida: Spring House, which is offering a basic seat at Rs 5,000 per month in Noida is charging Rs 7,500 in Gurgaon. Noida seats are price competitive because of the low rates of property rental in the region. \"Gurgaon co-working spaces are always more expensive because of the high rental costs of the property. Since Noida offers cheaper rent, it will be easier to offer cheaper seat-rates here. We are starting our Film City centre later this month at Rs 16,000 per month. We are starting our Gurgaon centre at Cyber City at Rs 21,000 per month. So theres a marked difference in prices,\" Ritesh Malik, founder-creator, Innov8 Coworking, said. With per day seats as low as Rs 300, and monthly rentals per seat starting from Rs 3,500, Noidas co-working spaces are going to be priced lowest among NCRs co-working hubs. With large spaces like 91springboard which has over 800 seats, is present in the city, the new spaces are expected to provide a more cohesive work ecology for the young start-ups. The small number of seats, vibrant work space, flexibility of timing, ample infrastructure - entrepreneurs cant get it better elsewhere in NCR. Besides, the metro connectivity is a significant factor for Noida. \"A young entrepreneur needs flexibility of timing, good mentoring and infrastructure. While Gurgaon is out of way for any Noida person, because of affordability and connectivity which Noida offers, a lot of enterpreneurs are beginning to work out of here,\" Pooja Bhayana, founder, Lets Barter, who works out of RevStart, said. Spring House, founded by Mukul Pasricha, has nine co-working spaces in Delhi and Gurugram. The tenth one opens on December 20 in Sector 8 with 130 seats. Out of them, 45 are already booked. \"To incubate ideas, one needs personnel connect and cohesive working. Co-working spaces are increasingly becoming popular. It is important that coworking founders get to connect with the entrepreneurs and then mentor them well, so their business grow,\" Pasricha said. \"I have mostly been using Innov8s CP facility. Location plays a big role in my work. But I have been actively working out of or attending events at co-working spaces in Gurgaon as well. Noida is a new and emerging market and it will catch up soon,\" Meghna Saraogi, founder, Style.Me said. \"Noidas connectivity and competitive pricing is increasingly going to make it a popular co-work destination.

Kumar Vineet, ADM (executive) Gautam Budh Nagar, said the administration had received information about irregularities in the allotment of homes in this scheme. \"We sent a team headed by the city magistrate to conduct an on-spot inspection of such homes in Sector 45. The officials inspected 500 homes and found irregularities in 105 of them. There were allottees who had shifted to other places and there were others who had rented out the homes to tenants, which is against the guidelines of the Yojna,\" he said. The allottees need to live in these houses and they cannot rent it out. The BSP government had floated the scheme in 2010 for allotment of homes to the urban poor in the city. Some homes were also reserved for disabled persons, widows, BPL card holders, and people belonging to backward castes. However, the investigating team also found that some homes were allotted to affluent allottees, who had four-wheelers parked outside their homes. \"This scheme is not for the affluent. This shows there have been irregularities in allotment of the homes,\" said an official. The district administration has started investigation of 1,200 other homes under this scheme. \"We have served notices to 105 home allottees and sought explanation from them in two weeks. Their homes will be cancelled if the allegations are found true,\" said an official. The officials also suspect that some people may have used forged documents to claim the allotment. The officials said they would register FIRs against the accused if found guilty.','CITY-NOIDA','','2017-12-16 02:20:00','TNN | Dec 16, 2017, 02:20 IST','2017-12-16 19:13:51'),(12,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/hindi-english-versions-of-draft-bill-miss-vary-on-many-provisions/articleshow/62090586.cms','Hindi, English versions of draft bill miss, vary on many provisions','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62090879,width-400,resizemode-4/62090879.jpg]','NOIDA: There are many differences between the English and Hindi versions of UP Self-Financed Independent Schools (Regulation of Fees) Bill, 2017, the parents have pointed out on Friday. While the Hindi version has a page saying that the bill is applicable to all those schools charging a possible annual fee and development fee over Rs 20,000, this important provision is missing in the English version. According to parents, \"annual fee\" is not defined in the bill. The bill also fails to clarify whether the fee is the total consolidated fee or the tuition fee. Ther are also many grammatical errors in important provisions. Sub-section (iii) of Section 1 of Chapter I of the Hindi version of the proposed bill says that the bill will be applicable to all the self-financed pre-primary, primary, upper primary, high schools and intermediate colleges affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), International Baccalaureate (IB), International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), UP Basic Education Council and the UP Secondary Education Council which have the possible annual fee and development fee of over Rs 20,000. \"This will also cover the minority institutions of the state. It will not cover the independent pre-primary schools,\" reads the sub-section. The page further gives a slew of definitions of the terminology used in the bill. However, the English version of the bill does not have the page providing the important provision that brings a school under the provisions of the Act. \"The bill is hurriedly drafted and it is clear from the fact that one of the most important conditions is missing from the English version. In any case, the makers have forgotten to explain whether the \"possible annual fee and development fee\" refers to the consolidated annual fee or the tuition fee. This loophole can help schools evade the provisions of the bill,\" Neeraj Bhatnagar, spokesperson, All India Parents Association (AIPA) said. There are errors in Section 5 of Chapter II on \"admission to school and fees\" which provides the rule for the \"proposed fee by management committee.\" \"The school may be permitted to increase or fix its fee beyond the permitted fee/increase fixation under Section 4 (i) and (ii) as above to ensure properly of the school while ensuring the total income of school as defined under section 6 (a) does not exceed the total expenditure as defined in clause 6 (b) plus the amount collected as development fund defined under section 6 (c) during previous year by submitted the proposal by zonal fee regulatory committee,\" reads the section. \"It seems the bill has legitimised the fee increase for maintaining property of the school but nothing is clear in this sentence which mentions \"properly.\" Further, it is not clear whether who is submitting this proposal for fee increase and to whom. How can we give suggestions in such a bill? ,\" asked a parent whose child studies in a private school of Sector 27. \"The discrepancies have not been pointed out to us. We will get them checked and rectify soon,\" principal secretary (secondary education) Sanjay Agarwal told TOI.

A number of abandoned or impounded cars and bikes, often covered in dust and ruins, jostle for space on the premises. This is the situation in most police stations like Indirapuram, Kavi Nagar or Vijay Nagar where many vehicles are abandoned even on roadsides as well as in green belts. The problem has been compounded by the regional transport department (RTO), which does not have a space of its own and park vehicles at police stations after seizing them during checking drives. As per the data, there are 298 unclaimed vehicles parked at 15 police stations in the district, though the office of the senior superintendent of police (SSP) does not have a record of how many of these vehicles are case properties. An SHO of a police station, who did not wish to be named, said: \"Our premises have been turned into a junkyard. Hundreds of vehicles have been lying here for years, but we cannot dispose them on our own. In many cases, even after a court order, people do not turn up to collect their vehicles. This happens mostly with vehicles involved in accidents, wherein people who have lost their kin do not want to take back them. There are also many vehicle owners who live in other cities or states and are not bothered to claim their property. Keeping an eye on these vehicles is a big hassle as miscreants are always on the lookout to steal stereos, tyres and other valuable parts from these vehicles.\" \"A lot of space will be available in the police station if the vehicles are removed. The available land can be used for developing a garden or for parking purpose,\" the SHO added. SP (city), Akash Tomar said the department periodically carries out auction of unclaimed vehicles to free up space, but cannot do so with those vehicles whose fate is to be decided by the court. \"Until an order is passed, we remain the custodian of the vehicle. There is no separate place to keep them, so they are parked at police stations,\" he added. When contacted, regional transport officer, A K Tripathi, said: \"We are acting as per the rules and hand over the vehicles to the nearest police stations after issuing seizure memo to owners.\" Tripathi added that the department has written to the transport commissioner for building a yard for parking such vehicles in the district.','CITY-NOIDA','Aditya Dev','2017-12-16 02:31:00','| TNN | Dec 16, 2017, 02:31 IST','2017-12-16 19:13:52'),(14,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/three-shoot-trader-dead-for-resisting-robbery/articleshow/62076089.cms','Three shoot trader dead for resisting robbery','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62076240,width-400,resizemode-4/62076240.jpg]','GHAZIABAD: A 23-year-old trader was allegedly shot dead while fighting off three bike-borne robbers in Giri Market in Loni on Thursday.

Speaking after the release of the Kumbh 2019s logo on Tuesday, the chief minister said: \"This mantra from the Vedas says that there is nothing incomplete in the Hindu religion. Everything is complete in its own sense and therefore, the word Ardh doesnt gel with the philosophy. So, we would be dropping the word Ardh and celebrate Kumbh 2019.\" Believed to be started by Adi Shankaracharya, the Kumbh marks congregation of all schools of thoughts associated with the Sanatan Dharma in Allahabad, Haridwar and Triyambakeshwar Nasik or Ujjain. The previous Kumbh was held in Allahabad in 2013. Talking about the logo, director general and principal secretary tourism, Awanish Awasthi said: \"Noted adman Prasoon Joshi has given shape to the CMs vision on the logo. The tagline for Kumbh Mela 2019 is Chalo Chalo Chalo, Kumbh Chalo.\" The CM also said that all official documents, government advertisements and hoardings would carry the logo to remind people about the event.

Kaushal, the groom said, \"I was the first among the 18 grooms riding the ghodi (horse) but as I reached the venue, I was told to leave the venue as they will not allow any non-Jaiswal to get married outside the community\".

The MCG says it has started vacuum sweeping of roads but the ground reality is different. Currently, the MCG has a fleet of five vacuum cleaning machines for four zones. It is paying a rent of Rs 65 lakh every month for road sweeping to control dust pollution. Each machine costs nearly Rs 1 crore and the corporation has hired them for Rs 13 lakh a month to clean nearly 30 km of road every night at a cost of Rs 700 per km. But the machines are shown to be working only in MCG records and are not seen at the sites where sweeping has been scheduled. During two surprise checks carried out by the sanitation department on December 2 and 4, the machines were not found at scheduled spots. According to the inspection report sent by the ground staff to MCG joint commissioners concerned, the machines were supposed to complete sweeping Rajiv Chowk and the railway station area but no machine was found at the sites. The report (a copy of which is with TOI) said as per plans, one machine was supposed to sweep the area from 4/7 Chowk to Gurgaon Railway Station to Daultabad flyover (zone 1). Another machine was to sweep the area from Rajiv Chowk to Civil Lines via New Railway Road to Gurgaon Railway Station (zone 2). The MCG had procured four vacuum cleaning machines in December 2016 to sweep the roads at night, mainly in areas where construction work was under way. Later, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board suggested the civic body to add more machines to its fleet and one was added. After the ground staff submitted the inspection report, senior MCG officials claimed it exposed negligence by the company operating the machines. When contacted, MCG senior sanitation official Ambika Prasad Sharma said the corporation would stop payment to the company, once bills were received at the end of the month. Also, penalty would be imposed on the company as per the contract norms, added Sharma. More surprise checks are being conducted by his team to check whether the sweeping work is under way or not. While action is awaited, experts have raised doubts over the effectiveness of sweeping machines. \"Road sweeping using vacuum cleaning machines is not a very efficient method to curb dust pollution. Most of the city roads are in bad shape with potholes and the machines will not function there,\" said Devendra Singh, a city-based environmentalist, adding that rollers at the bottom of the machines could work only on uniform surfaces.','CITY-GURGAON','','2017-12-15 01:11:00','TNN | Dec 15, 2017, 01:11 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:09'),(33,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/114-rise-in-property-tax-collection/articleshow/62090517.cms','114% rise in property tax collection','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62090778,width-400,resizemode-4/62090778.jpg]','GURUGRAM: MCG has seen a two-fold increase in property tax collection between December 2016 and December 2017, compared to the previous year.

But the same cant be said of footballers from Haryana, who find themselves caught in a bitter battle between two political factions of the state football body, which has led to de-recognition of Haryana Football Association (HFA) by the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The players are staring at a bleak future, and most likely wont take part in the next edition of Santosh Trophy, the premier inter-state tournament. Even at a junior national tournament held in Punjab this month, there was no team from the state. According to an officials who spoke to TOI about the fiasco, HFA has two factions — a Congress and a BJP one — and there has always been a power struggle between the two. Deepender Singh Hooda was the president of HFA when Congress was in power. After the party lost the state elections in 2014 and BJP came to power, they demanded Hooda should step down and be replaced by someone from their faction. Hooda opposed this, but stepped down as president, to be replaced by current president Rao Dan Singh, also of Congress, as his faction still had two years of tenure remaining. BJP opposed this appointment and selected Suraj Pal Amu as their president-nominee. Hooda and his party moved court. Amu was recently in the news for announcing a Rs 10-crore bounty on the heads of actor Deepika Padukone and filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali as he protested against Padmavati. The HFA case will be heard by the Sonipat court on January 6 next year. Till then, the court has asked AIFF to suspend HFA, and players from Haryana are barred from representing the state anywhere. This infighting has forced footballing talent from the state move elsewhere. Currently, footballers from Haryana are only able to participate nationally in school and university tourneys. Many players from the state have already changed their domicile to other states. Priyadarshan and Rajat Rathi from Gurgaon have been selected for the Delhi team. \"If this infighting continues, well be left with no future. Im representing Delhi in the junior nationals. Being from Haryana, it doesnt feel great to represent another state, but at this moment, my career is my priority,\" said Rajat. There are many other talented players who feel left out due to the ban. \"Haryana has no proper team. The infrastructure is also hopeless. I gave trials for the Delhi team because I knew there is no future in my state. Coaches never show up and the practice grounds are in pathetic condition,\" said Ishan Sharma, a U-17 player from Haryana. The district sports association has decided to stay away from the entire issue. \"I dont want to get into all this. It is a political issue so please keep me out of it,\" said Paras Ram, district sports officer. \"This fight between two HFA factions is taking a toll on the future of its footballers. If one faction wins in the lower court, the other one will challenge it in a higher court.

The reason for introducing an efficient city bus service is to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road and to ensure that commuters switch to public transport,\" said a GMCBL official. \"Delhi Integrated Multi Modal Transit System (DIMTS) has already conducted a few initial surveys to plan the new bus routes and rationalise the already existing routes. For effective usefulness of the bus service, there is a need to develop an adequate bus route system based on origin and destination of users. Connectivity of various city nodes is also important.

TOI reported the story Senior couple duped out of Rs 2 crore in land fraud in February 2015 when the first victim, 72-yr-old KK Sharma, a resident of Delhis Punjabi Bagh, had filed a police complaint against the couple at Sushant Lok police station. Since then, the couple has not only managed to evade arrest but even travelled abroad and are now settled in Delhi. The victims allege they posted photos of their vacation in Dubai, Sri Lanka and Nepal on social networking sites. But, according to IG (state crime) Saurabh Singh, the department has not been able to track the couple down. \"We have issued proclaimed offender notice against the couple. They had applied for bail in a local court but it was rejected after which they are on the run. The crime branch teams are investigating the cases and they will soon be arrested,\" he said. Asked how the couple managed to attend parties in Delhi, the IG said he would seek reply from his Gurgaon team \"if claims are found to be true\". Another victim, Ravinder Sehgal, was also duped of over Rs 1 crore in name of agreement to sell ground floor and basement of the under-construction building on the said land. \"Despite three FIRs against the accused , no action has been taken by Sushant Lok police, after which it was transferred to state crime branch,\" he said. \"Whenever we approach the cops, they express helplessness claiming they are unable to get a clue about the whereabouts of the couple. On the other hand, the couple is active on social networking sites, frequently uploading photos of high-profile social gatherings in Delhi and NCR.\" Citing an incident, he said after seeing the photos of Ripika partying at a five-star hotel in Delhi on a social networking site, he informed police. \"By the time, we reached the venue along with cops, the party was over and the couple had left. The hotel management confirmed the accused were present at the party,\" he added. The first complainant, Sharma, said, \"During meets with families, they offer attractive deals for the their property and accept earnest money between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore, but delay the execution of sale deed. In the meantime, they change their address and contact numbers to avoid queries by the victims.\" In his police complaint to economic offences wing of Gurgaon police in February 2015, Sharma alleged he was duped of Rs 1.25 crore by the couple. After duping Sharma, the couple entered into an agreement to sale the first floor of the under construction building with Nikhil Mansharamani and took Rs 50 lakh from him as earnest money. But again the sale deed was not executed. And in similar fashion, the couple cheated two other families.','CITY-GURGAON','','2017-12-16 02:05:00','TNN | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 02:05 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:18'),(50,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/owner-booked-as-bullmastiff-bites-boy/articleshow/62090369.cms','Owner booked as Bullmastiff bites boy','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62090368,width-400,resizemode-4/62090368.jpg]','GURUGRAM: An 11-year-old boy was seriously injured earlier this week after his neighbours Bullmastiff attacked him, biting at his head.

The accused, Dr Devendra Patel, today appeared in a federal court in Reno city of Nevada. He was charged with 36- counts of distribution of controlled substances such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, and three-counts of health care fraud. The statutory maximum penalty for distribution of a controlled substance is 10 years in prison and the maximum penalty for healthcare fraud is 10 years in prison. Federal prosecutors alleged that from May 2014 to September 2017, Patel routinely prescribed fentanyl, hydrocodone, and oxycodone for his patients without a legitimate medical purpose and that he fraudulently billed Medicare and Medicaid for medical tests that he did not perform. The indictment alleges that Patel performed EKGs on his patients, so he could then order nuclear stress tests which he did not administer. He allegedly used a poorly calibrated machine and presented his patients with fraudulent X-rays, in order to deceive his patients into thinking they had coronary issues that needed to be treated by him, the indictment alleged. \"Dr. Patel is the first person to be charged in Nevada since the formation of the Justice Departments Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit,\" Acting US Attorney Steven Myhre said. \"Despite his physicians oath to do no harm, Dr Patel recklessly prescribed opioids, for no legitimate medical purpose,\" stated FBI Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse.

Sherin, reported missing on October 7, was found dead in a culvert about 1 km from her home in suburban Dallas on October 22. Her autopsy report is still awaited. She was adopted by the Indian-American couple, Wesley and Sini Mathews, from an orphanage in India last year. Her adoptive parents lost custody of their biological child after Sherin went missing. Her parents appeared before a court yesterday for a long Child Protective Services (CPS) custody hearing about their biological daughter, currently living with relatives in the Houston-area. Wesley was brought to the courthouse in a van. He is expected to either surrender his parental rights for his 3- year-old daughter or have them terminated by the state. Sini, who aims to regain custody of her biological daughter sought right to visit her. Sini took to the witness stand first, but invoked her fifth amendment right not to incriminate herself many times during questioning. One exception came when she was asked if she is trained a nurse -- to which she responded, \"yes\". When Wesley took the stand, he opted to invoke his fifth amendment right as well and answered no questions pertaining to Sherins death or disappearance. Prosecution pressed Sini about the previous CPS involvement, alleging Sherin earlier had a broken femur, elbow and tibia, but she did not confirm the allegations. The prosecution called to the stand a pediatrician and child abuse expert, Susan Dakil of Referral and Evaluation of At Risk Children Clinic, who testified that the injuries were visible in various X-ray scans taken in September 2016 and February 2017. Dakil said the scans suggest the injuries were inflicted after Sherin was adopted from India. The X-rays from February showed that fractures in Sherins tibia and femur were in different stages of healing, WFAA reported. The pattern of injuries led Dakil to believe that Sherin was injured on separate occasions, but she could not say when they occurred. The doctor filed a report with Child Protective Services after seeing the X-rays, the station reported. The hearing, which ended for the week, will resume on Tuesday. Two more witnesses are scheduled to take the stand. Sherin Mathews had a series of broken bones and injuries, a doctor testified before the court. Mathews, reported missing on October 7, was found dead on October 22. Her foster father was arrested and charged with felony injury to a child, Sini, who is behind bars on child endangerment charges, had her bond reduced from $250,000 to $100,000 on Monday. Wesley was arrested and charged with felony injury to a child, which carries a sentence of up to life in prison.

The Indian diaspora constitutes 6% of the total number of international migrants (people living outside the country of their birth), which was estimated at 243 million in 2015. The global figure has risen by 10% over that recorded in 2010, a recently released United Nations report said. In other words, out of a global population of 7.3 billion, one of every 30 people was a migrant in 2015. However, if computed as a percentage of the worlds population, the growth of thediaspora has been largely static, from 3.2% in 2010 to 3.3% in 2015, according to the World Migration Report (2018), published by the International Organisation for Migration, a UN agency. According to the report, nearly half of all the international migrants worldwide in 2015 were born in Asia, primarily originating from India, China and other South Asian countries. After India, Mexico has the second largest diaspora. Russia, China, Bangladesh and Pakistan follow (see graphic). Notably, people in the working age group, between 20 to 64 years, account for a significant chunk of the international migrant population, nearly 72%. Since 1970, the US has been the main destination for international migrants. The number of foreign-born people residing in the US has almost quadrupled from fewer than 12 million in 1970 to 46.6 million in 2015 (of whichnearly two million were of Indian origin). The Gulf nations house the biggest share of the Indian diaspora — nearly 3.5 million or 22% of the total Indian diaspora were in the UAE, and 1.9 million (or 12%) in Saudi Arabia. According to immigration experts, protectionist measures adopted in these and other countries will eventually transform the diaspora landscape. We are witnessing intense vetting of applications for H-1B, the most popular work visa for Indians headed to the US, and entry into the US is likely to involve stricter rules. The number of migrants to the Gulf has dipped drastically in recent years, owing to economic conditions and the protectionist measures adopted by these countries. As reported earlier by TOI, pan-India emigration clearance for the Gulf in 2016, 5.07 lakh, showed a decline of 33% as compared to the previous calendar year. The decline trend has continued in 2017.','INDIA','Lubna Kably','2017-12-15 08:26:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 15, 2017, 08:26 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:24'),(55,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/other-news/iit-kanpur-graduate-launches-new-company-in-seoul/articleshow/62026291.cms','IIT Kanpur graduate launches new company in Seoul','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62026321,width-400,resizemode-4/62026321.jpg]','SEOUL: Pankaj Agarwal, a 35-year-old IIT Kanpur graduate, has founded a start-up company, TagHive, with a few like-minded professionals in Seoul to pursue his passion for improving education. His mission is to revolutionise everyday experiences with a smart tag solution -- a combination of a button type tag, a smart app and back-end analytics that are targeted at reinventing interactions for kids at play and at school. Based in South Korea since 2004, he had earlier worked with Samsung Electronics. Samsung encouraged him with support for his endeavour. TagHive is a technology company that was spun off from Samsung Electronics in April this year. TagHives new solutions are TagPlus and LEAP. While TagPlus, an award winning solution, is the worlds first toy-centric social network for kids, LEAP is a low cost clicker (Classroom Response System) along with an app (iOS and Android) that will keep students engaged, parents informed and help teachers effectively manage their classrooms. Speaking to TOI, Agarwal said that TagHive will commercialise LEAP in South Korea in the first half of 2018 and enter the Indian market in the second half of 2018. \"We are looking to partner with schools in India willing to ride the new wave of affordable smarter classrooms,\" he said. TagHive pilot tested the LEAP solution in Ambience Public School in New Delhi, as well as in South Korea, with encouraging response. Some of the key features of LEAP are \"one-click attendance\" which reduces the morning chaos of recording attendance with students simply clicking their tags. Teachers can now utilise the time saved more productively in teaching more, Agarwal said. LEAP allows teachers to have an accumulated score for their students on a daily basis and the students will be given incentives to improve their behaviour. It further allows teachers to create their own quizzes and polls for various subjects. Students can record their responses by clicking their tags. \"Teachers can view all student records like attendance, score and quiz/poll results for one day, one week, one month or for the whole semester,\" said Agarwal. It also automatically sends students performance updates to their respective parents. Parents will also have an app where they can track their kids progress in real time. \"I have a 10-year-old son, and I want the best for him,\" said Agarwal. Agarwal is the founder and President of IIT Alumni Association of Korea (IITAAK). He also has an MBA degree from the Harvard Business School. He said IITians have left their mark in most parts of the world and IITAAK wants to replicate that in South Korea and strengthen the reputation of brand IIT. \"We hope that this will not only make our lives here more meaningful but also help in forging more productive cooperation between South Korea and India,\" he said.','NRI-OTHER-NEWS','Oinam Sunil','2017-12-11 21:38:00','| TNN | Dec 11, 2017, 21:38 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:25'),(56,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/kamala-harris-calls-on-trump-to-quit-over-misconduct-allegations/articleshow/62091979.cms','Kamala Harris calls on Trump to quit over misconduct allegations','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62091980,width-400,resizemode-4/62091980.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Kamala Harris, the first Indian-American senator, has called for Donald Trumps resignation, becoming the seventh lawmaker to demand it amid resurfaced allegations of sexual misconduct against the US President. The allegations of sexual misconduct against the 71-year old Trump have received renewed attention recently after several prominent men in the worlds of politics, entertainment and media have been accused of sexual harassment, assault and rape. \"I think he should resign in the best interest of the country,\" the 53-year-old California Democrat told Politico yesterday. Harris has joined six other Democratic senators - Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, Jeff Merkley, Mazie Hirono and Ron Wyden - who have called for Trump to resign. Over the past two years, about 16 women have accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them prior to his assuming the presidency. Three of the Trumps accusers at a news conference on Tuesday demanded that the US Congress investigate their allegations against the US President. They detailed their accounts of being groped, fondled and forcibly kissed by the businessman-turned-politician. Harris said she believed Trumps accusers and that \"there should be some inquiry into the veracity of their claims\". Asked if the country had reached a turning point on issues of sexual harassment, Harris said, \"I dont think we have arrived at that point\". \"There have been people saying, Well, this is the issue for the women of the Senate which is ridiculous. We still have a lot of work to do on having people understand this is everyones issue,\" she was quoted as saying. Trump has repeatedly denied accusations of sexual misconduct, taking to Twitter this week to deride what he called \"false accusations and fabricated stories\". \"Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent, the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I dont know and/or have never met. FAKE NEWS!,\" Trump tweeted. Last year, Trump dismissed the allegations as \"false\". He downplayed his remarks in a video that showed him making lewd remarks as nothing more than \"locker room talk\" at the second presidential debate and said he has never kissed or groped women without consent. US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Monday that women who accuse a man of inappropriate sexual behaviour - including Trump - \"should be heard.\" \"Women who accuse anyone should be heard,\" the Indian- American top diplomat said when asked specifically about Trumps accusers. \"They should be heard and they should be dealt with.

Monir Miah, 58, admitted lying about his income from The Crown of India restaurant, in High Street, Stone, and falsifying value-added tax (VAT) repayment claims, after he was investigated by the Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Routine tax checks raised concerns and Miah was offered the chance to put his tax affairs in order, declare any mistakes or irregularities and pay what he owed in full, plus interest and penalties, through HMRCs civil Contractual Disclosure Facility (CDF). The owner of the Indian restaurant in Staffordshire has been jailed for two years after stealing 90,000 pounds in tax after test purchases revealed his fraud, the official spkesperson of the HMRC said. But Miah only declared half the business the restaurant was doing and deregistered for VAT. The HMRC began a criminal prosecution as Miah had failed to make a full disclosure and continued to lie about his business. The investigation clearly showed how he was illegally under-declaring the true scale of his restaurant business. HMRC officers discovered the truth by tracing customer payments, counting customers on the premises, and doing test purchases on specific dates, which were compared with his records and tax returns. Paul Maybury, Assistant Director, Fraud Investigation Service, HMRC said, While Miah, and his family, enjoyed the illegal untaxed income from his restaurant he was depriving public services of vital funding and gave himself an unfair advantage over his honest competitors. He was offered the opportunity to put his tax affairs in order through the Contractual Disclosure Facility. Instead he made a conscious decision to make only a partial disclosure of the tax offences he had committed. He could have been spared a criminal conviction had he fully cooperated with HMRC. On sentencing Miah, Judge Martin Walsh said the crime was sophisticated in the way it was carried out. \"It was an intentional act of dishonesty on your part and you were given opportunity in 2016 to come clean but declined that opportunity. It was a calculated dishonesty designed to achieve a significant financial benefit to yourself and a loss to the revenue,\" Walsh said. Miah became the sixth person to be convicted for failing to comply with the Contractual Disclosure Facility (CDF) in the last 18 months.','NRI-OTHER-NEWS','','2017-12-13 21:54:00','PTI | Dec 13, 2017, 21:54 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:27'),(58,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/new-jersey-governor-elect-nominates-first-sikh-american-as-state-attorney-general/articleshow/62043371.cms','New Jersey Governor elect nominates first Sikh-American as state Attorney General','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62043568,width-400,resizemode-4/62043568.jpg]','WASHINGTON: New Jersey Governor-elect Phil Murphy today named Gurbir S Grewal as his nominee to serve as the next Attorney General of the state.

The move is aimed at addressing the crucial issue of job creation in the country. The policy is likely to be announced in the upcoming Budget, the last full one that will be presented by this government before general elections in 2019. The multi-pronged employment policy will include incentives for employers to create more jobs, reforms to attract enterprises and help for medium and small scale industries, which are major job providers, a senior government official told ET. The idea is to address the twin issues of providing quality jobs to over 10 million youth being added to the countrys workforce every year and ensuring that more of these are created in the formal sector. As of now, barely 10% of the countrys 400 million workforce is in the organised sector. \"The policy will moot fiscal incentives for employers across labourintensive sectors to create more jobs as well as employees to get engaged in the organised sector as this would fetch them minimum wages and enough social security,\" the official said. The plan comes amid rising pressure to speed up job creation in sync with economic growth so that incomes rise and millions of people are lifted out of poverty. \"Economic growth would need capacity building in infrastructure, commodities, manufacturing, consumer goods and services and each of these sectors will create new jobs and upgraded jobs,\" said MS Unnikrishnan, chairman of the national committee on industrial relations at the Confederation of Indian Industry. \"In light of this, we need to have a flexible employment policy that protects the interest of both employer and employee. This means it has to be viable and attractive for investors and provide for a social security system for our workers.\" The pace of job creation fell to a six-year low in 2015 with 135,000 new jobs being created compared with 421,000 in 2014 and 419,000 in 2013, according to a quarterly survey of industries by the Labour Bureau of the labour ministry. Another survey of households conducted by the Labour Bureau showed unemployment rate rising to a five-year high of 5% in FY16 compared with 4.9% in FY14 and 4.7% in FY13.

Weeks before the July 1 start of Indias biggest tax overhaul in decades, the government declared itself ready and chided industry experts who said more time was needed to prepare for the changes. \"Its not a complicated process,\" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said on June 20. However, more than 10 tax and IT consultants who worked on the project said that behind the scenes the government was ignoring warnings for more testing of the complex system even as it was pushing through late changes. While the sources said Infosys, which built the GST technological network, made \"basic errors\", they said government officials have not accepted any responsibility for the glitches in the GST roll out. The government is still making changes to tax rates, filing deadlines, and other features, making it difficult to stabilise the system, they said, declining to be identified for fear of losing future government contracts. \"At that time, the powers in New Delhi were mocking industry, saying the governments ready, but industrys not,\" said the director of a financial planning firm involved in developing the GST network. \"Now people are laughingly asking, so who was really not ready?\" he said. The finance ministry and GSTN, the government authority managing the GST network, declined to comment on specific problems about the GST rollout or specific warnings by industry that more time was needed for testing. The GST law was debated for decades, industry had enough time to prepare, and glitches are being fixed, a finance ministry spokesman said. Infosys said in a statement that \"several stakeholder concerns\" had been raised about the GST system and some of its best engineers were working to resolve all issues. Warnings The GST system has been designed to replace a slew of central and state taxes and has been hailed by Moodys Investors Service as the tax that would boost the economy by removing trade barriers between states. However, since launch, the system has been beset by problems from a confusing tax structure with four main rates to technical glitches that make it unstable. The sources said they had warned government officials in the run up to the launch that a key part of the GST technology, allowing users to connect to the GST network, was not working smoothly. There were other technical flaws that resulted in incorrect tax assessments, they said. One technology officer involved in the GST rollout said his company had to deal with a \"revolving door\" of government requests in the run up to the launch. The director of the financial planning firm said the government was \"adamant\" on introducing GST on July 1. \"Obviously, it led to chaos,\" he said. The disruption wrought by GST has been blamed in part for a slide in economic growth to a three-year low in the April-June quarter. Growth however has rebounded in the following quarter. A person working for an audit firm said in one example, a test adopted by GSTN did not reflect real-world conditions. \"GSTN in the month of April and May gave 100 companies an invoice to upload and see whether it was getting uploaded or not,\" he said. \"You cant really test the system by taking one invoice as a sample,\" he said. \"GSTN told companies it would do more testing with a larger number of transactions. That never happened.\" However, Prakash Kumar, the head of GSTN, said \"a phased approach was adopted\" at launch and \"change is a constant in large IT projects.\" A top finance ministry official, who declined to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to the media, said Infosys failed to understand \"the gravity of the situation\" in building the network. \"No doubt, the government didnt realise the difficulties that would be faced,\" he said. \"But Infosys is also responsible.\"','BUSINESS-INDIA-BUSINESS','','2017-12-16 16:43:00','Reuters | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 16:43 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:31'),(63,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bfsi-to-constitute-40-of-sensex-an-all-time-high/articleshow/62091181.cms','Banks, insurance, financial service stocks to constitute 40% of Sensex, an all-time high','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62093469,width-400,resizemode-4/62093469.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/62093553/Master.jpg]','MUMBAI: The reconstitution of the benchmark 30-share Sensex from December 18 would result in the weightage of BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) companies increasing by 3.3 per cent to an all-time high of 40.1 per cent.

With the exit of Cipla (0.9 per cent weightage) and Lupin (0.6 per cent), healthcare stands to lose the most from the reshuffle. The weightage of healthcare firms would decline 1.6 per cent to 2.6 per cent, the lowest in seven years. Other losers include automobiles that would shed 0.4 per cent and technology, consumer-oriented firms and oil and gas companies, which would have 0.3 per cent lower weightage in the benchmark index. Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) would have 0.2 per cent lower weightage on the Sensex.

BFSI and technology firms would account for more than half of the index after the change. Companies from BFSI and technology sectors would have a combined weightage of 51.4 per cent, data compiled by Motilal Oswal Securities showed. The share of private banks in the Sensex has increased nearly 2.5 times in the last nine years. The weightage of BSFI companies on the index has nearly doubled during the timeframe.

Goyal said gross advances by public sector banks jumped nearly seven-times in nine years from Rs 8.08 lakh crore in March 2005 to Rs 52.15 lakh crore by March 2014, however, the GDP didnt grow at a similar pace, meaning there was reckless and indiscriminate lending due to political pressures.

The Federal Communications Commission, in a 3-2 vote, yesterday adopted a proposal by Republican-appointed chairman Pai. The action reversed the agencys 2015 decision, during the previous Obama administration, to have stronger oversight over broadband providers. The agency scrapped regulations that prohibited broadband providers from blocking websites or charging for higher- quality service or certain content. The federal government will also no longer regulate high-speed internet delivery as if it were a utility, like phone service. The critics say the move is against the interest of the consumers and favours big corporate companies. Pai and others in favour of the decision argued the deregulation of the internet would spur innovation, and that the Federal Trade Commission would have the authority to sue providers who abuse competition on the web. Yesterdays decision restores the longstanding, bipartisan light-touch regulatory framework that has fostered rapid Internet growth, openness, and freedom for nearly 20 years, the FCC said in a statement after the voting. Following detailed legal and economic analysis, as well as extensive examination of comments from consumers and stakeholders, the Commission reversed the FCCs 2015 heavy- handed utility-style regulation of broadband internet access service, which imposed substantial costs on the entire internet ecosystem, it said. In place of that heavy-handed framework, the FCC is returning to the traditional light-touch framework that was in place until 2015, it asserted. Moreover, the FCC also adopted robust transparency requirements that will empower consumers as well as facilitate effective government oversight of broadband providers conduct, it said. \"In particular, the FCCs action has restored the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission to act when broadband providers engage in anticompetitive, unfair, or deceptive acts or practices,\" the federal commission said. It will take weeks for the repeal to go into effect, but the political and legal fight started immediately. Numerous Democrats called for a bill that would reestablish the rules, and several Democratic state attorneys general said they would file a suit to stop the change. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the FCCs radical, partisan decision to dismantle net neutrality \"strikes a stunning blow\" to the promise of a free and open internet. \"With this unjustified and blatant giveaway to big providers, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is proving himself an eager executor of the Trump Administrations anti-consumer, anti- competition agenda,\" she said. Pelosi alleged that FCCs rule change process was marked by haste, secrecy and technical flaws from the start. \"This arbitrary decision was made without a single public hearing and over the firm opposition of Internet experts and technologists,\" she said. \"It is deeply disturbing that Pais FCC has refused to take action to combat the threat of identity theft and fake comments in the agency record, and has refused to comply with FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests or requests for information from the New York Attorney Generals Investigation,\" Pelosi said. Several public interest groups including Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition also promised to file a suit. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents big tech firms such as Google and Facebook, said it also was considering legal action. \"The Internet industry opposes Chairman Pais repeal of the 2015 Open Internet Order,\" Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association, a trade group representing Amazon, Facebook, Google and other tech companies, said in a statement. \"Relying on ISPs (Internet service providers) to live up to their own promises is not net neutrality and is bad for consumers.\" \"The fight isnt over. Internet Association is currently weighing our legal options in a lawsuit against todays order, and remains open to Congress enshrining strong, enforceable net neutrality protections into law.\" Netflix ripped the FCCs decision to repeal net neutrality rules, calling it \"misguided\". \"This is the beginning of a longer legal battle. Netflix stands w/ innovators, large & small, to oppose this misguided FCC order,\" the company tweeted shortly after the FCC voted on the measure. \"The @FCCs vote to gut #NetNeutrality rules is a body blow to innovation and free expression. We will continue our fight to defend the open internet and reverse this misguided decision,\" Twitter Public Policy said in a tweet. Pai defended the repeal before the vote, saying the rollback of the rules would eventually benefit consumers because broadband providers like AT&T and Comcast could offer them a wider variety of service options. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in a statement he will lead a multi-state lawsuit to challenge the reversal. House Speaker Paul Ryan welcomed the decision. \"Despite its unassuming name, the Obama administrations net neutrality regulation threatens the free and open Internet that has done so much to advance modern society,\" he said. The Trump administrations action to roll back this egregious government overreach into the most innovative space will benefit all users of the internet, he said.','BUSINESS-INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS','','2017-12-15 14:15:00','PTI | Dec 15, 2017, 14:15 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:33'),(67,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/entry-into-africa-one-of-my-biggest-regrets-sunil-mittal/articleshow/62096665.cms','Entry into Africa one of my biggest regrets, says Bharti Airtel chief Sunil Mittal','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62091627,width-400,resizemode-4/62091627.jpg]','NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtels entry into the African market in 2010 — through a nearly $11-billion acquisition — was perhaps not correct and is one of \"my biggest regrets\", says chairman Sunil Mittal, who has battled many a challenges in the highly competitive telecom business over two decades.

Airtel had ventured into the African market in 2010 with an ambitious and expensive purchase of Kuwait-based Zain Telecoms assets there. But, it has still not managed to make the business profitable. \"We all must have made lots of mistakes. Lots of decisions, when you look back, I wish they were better thought through.

However, Mittal said that things have been turning around. \"In Africa, thankfully, it is a much better place today. It is cash-flow positive.\" He said work is constantly on to address African business. \"Every entrepreneur comes to a point where you make some mistakes and the only thing is that you should recognise it, and try to fix it as fast as you can... having taken that decision, you need to back it, you need to fix it.

The government is likely to raise around Rs 70,000 crore by February 2018 as part of the total Rs 1.35 lakh crore to be met through recapitalisation bonds. A demand has been raised through the second batch of supplementary demands for grants, the official said. \"It was already stated that most of the amount will be frontloaded so as to pass on the maximum benefit to the lenders,\" he said. In October, the government had announced a Rs 2.11 lakh crore capital infusion plan for state-owned banks to encourage lending and boost investment. Of the total, Rs 58,000 crore is to be raised by the banks themselves. \"The government will directly issue these bonds and the impact on the fiscal will be discounted given the increase in credit growth and subsequent pickup of the economy,\" the official said. The immediate impact on the budget will be to the extent of interest the government will have to pay on the bonds. Cash-rich central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) will be encouraged to subscribe to the bonds besides other financial institutions such as the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). Another finance ministry official said discussions have been held with all state-run banks on certain key performance areas during PSB Manthan, a two-day conclave for public sector banks The finance ministry is already holding discussions with stateowned banks on their key financial ratios. \"The larger view is that consolidation in PSBs should only happen once we have improved their financials,\" said the official cited above. Half a dozen banks are slated to raise capital from the markets mostly through qualified institutional placements (QIPs) in the next two months. Delhi-based Punjab National Bank already has approval to raise Rs 5,000 crore through this route. The other banks include Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Union Bank of India and Andhra Bank.

The development comes as the income tax department launched searches on top Bitcoin exchanges including Zebpay, Unocoin and CoinSecure on Wednesday. According to the indirect tax officers, the investigations began probe about a month back and top executives and promoters of some Bitcoin exchanges were asked to explain their business model and how much indirect tax — either service tax or value-added tax — could be levied on the last financial years revenue. \"There is ambiguity around how much sales tax is applicable on revenues of these startups as the product they deal in is not defined by the current tax laws,\" said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. \"No satisfactory answer is yet provided by any of these Bitcoin startups.\" Asenior executive at one of the top seven Bitcoin exchanges in the country confirmed that both direct and indirect tax officials have been questioning the company about its business model and taxability. \"While the indirect tax department has been calling senior executives since mid-November, the direct tax officials started reaching out to us two weeks back,\" the person said. Bitcoin is the most popular among digital currencies that allow online payments directly from one person to another without any middlemen or going through any financial institution. With many businesses beginning to accept them, there is rising demand for such cryptocurrencies that come without any government control and allow anonymous transactions. More than that, Bitcoin has become a craze among investors, with its value skyrocketing more than 1,200% in 2017 alone. Price of one Bitcoin stood at $17,900, or .`11.46 lakh, on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange as on Friday evening. Among other things the tax department wants to know if Bitcoins are currency, goods or services. Tax rates would depend on how the product is defined. \"Bitcoin may not qualify as currency or money as it is not a legal tender for Indian indirect tax laws,\" said Pratik Jain, national leader, indirect tax, PwC. \"Therefore, VAT (value-added tax) or GST implications may arise. In case it is sold to overseas customers from India it may qualify as export.\" However, if there is a commission or fee earned in the transaction, then the business of Bitcoin exchanges is likely to be viewed as a service, Jain said. \"There are several grey areas which need to be investigated, in light of the precedence and guidance available under laws of other countries.\" Industry insiders said that Bitcoin players, including Indian exchanges, earn their revenue through commission, transaction fees or price arbitrage. There was no response to queries sent to Zebpay and CoinSecure on Wednesday. Unocoin told ET: \"Given that we have not received any notice, none of your questions are relevant.\" No tax notices have been issued yet. That can happen only after an investigation is concluded and the exact tax applicable is determined. One person close to the development said the indirect tax department is likely to issue demand orders to Bitcoin exchanges by the first quarter of next year. \"The sales tax department and VAT authorities would be well within their rights to issue arbitrary demand orders (for 2016-17, before the implementation of GST),\" the person said. GST was put in place on July 1. According to another person in the know, VAT authorities from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka have separately initiated an inquiry to determine if Bitcoin exchanges are liable to the tax. Tax experts said calculating indirect tax on the revenue earned by the Bitcoin startups is causing problems due to lack of clarity around the place of supply provisions. Income-tax authorities too are on the trail of the Indian Bitcoin sector. ET reported on Monday on an ambiguity in income tax to be paid by Bitcoin holders in India. According to people with direct knowledge of the matter, the income tax authorities wanted access to data on Indian Bitcoin holders and the gains they have made. The stratospheric rise in Bitcoin valuation has prompted several investors and experts, including Warren Buffet and JP Morgans Jamie Dimon, to warn that it is a bubble. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has so far issued three warnings against Bitcoins — the first in 2013, the second in February this year and the third last week. There are 1,600 types of cryptocurrencies available across the globe based on blockchain technology. The more common ones include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and Dash. \"One needs to choose a cryptocurrency wallet and an exchange to trade on the currency,\" said Vishal Gupta, founder of SearchTrade, a search engine company that uses Bitcoins to pay users every time they search on the platform. \"From there it is as simple as filling out a form and waiting for the transaction to process.\" Gupta, who also cofounded the Digital Assets and Blockchain Foundation India (DABFI), however, declined to share how players (wallet or facilitators) earn their revenues.','BUSINESS-INDIA-BUSINESS','Sachin Dave and Vishal Dutta','2017-12-16 11:39:00','| ET Bureau | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 11:39 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:34'),(70,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/wholesale-inflation-for-november-at-8-month-high-of-3-93/articleshow/62065835.cms','Wholesale inflation for November at 8-month high of 3.93%','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62065864,width-400,resizemode-4/62065864.jpg]','NEW DELHI: Inflation based on wholesale price index (WPI) accelerated further to 3.93 per cent in November due to a sharp rise in onion prices and costlier seasonal vegetables, government data showed on Thursday.

By mid-2019, about seven in 10 firms are anticipated to deploy AI. IDC surveyed 194 Indian companies across four verticals — telecom, media & technology (TMT); retail; banking, financial services, & insurance (BFSI) and healthcare. The report said nearly 75 per cent of the firms surveyed anticipate benefits in business process efficiency and employee productivity with the use of AI, and 64 per cent of the respondents believe that this technology can empower them in revenue augmentation through better targeting of offers and improved sales processes. Despite a higher propensity to adopt AI, firms believe they will face a shortage of skills to unlock the opportunities through AI. \"We all talk about the opportunity that India presents for AI, but often the types of industries that will embrace AI, the challenges that AI can address, and the roadblocks in implementation, are vague. This research is a small step towards comprehending this knowledge, and enabling companies such as ours, shape strategy and move ahead in the right direction,\" said Prakash Mallya, managing director for sales and marketing at Intel India. The TMT industry emerges as the top early adopter of AI, with a current adoption rate of 37.5 per cent, followed by BFSI, and healthcare. At least 71 per cent of organisations are looking at increased process automation as a key benefit and an almost equal number of firms (69 per cent) are looking at increased employee productivity across several business functions, the report said. However, concerns around adoption of AI continue with high cost of solutions, acute shortage of skilled professionals, unclear return on investment, and cybersecurity emerging as the key hindrances. To bridge the talent gap, the Intel AI Academy Program that covers training on Intels distribution of Python (leading AI programming language), tools, libraries, frameworks and platforms for AI, is targeted at educating 15,000 scientists, developers, analysts, and engineers on key AI technologies.','BUSINESS-INDIA-BUSINESS','','2017-12-15 10:05:00','TNN | Updated: Dec 15, 2017, 10:05 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:35'),(72,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/for-money-launderers-its-no-longer-dubai-duty-free/articleshow/62080312.cms','For money launderers, it’s no longer Dubai duty free','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62076046,width-400,resizemode-4/62076046.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/62076121/Master.jpg]','MUMBAI: From January 1, Dubai will lose some of its charm for money launderers with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) imposing value-added tax (VAT). The new and the first-ever tax in the Gulf region will not only make laundering more expensive but compliance with VAT regulations will leave a paper trail. For decades, paper transactions between newly formed entities in UAE were shown as genuine business deals to legitimise undisclosed, untaxed income. Once the colour of money changed from black to white, the funds were parked with banks in Dubai or invested in other countries or found its way back to India as foreign direct investment in Indian companies. In regularising undeclared funds from Switzerland or other tax havens that came under glare, money moved from these jurisdictions to accounts of companies floated in Dubai. These companies booked such inflows as trading income, or commission or consultancy fee. Such transactions will now attract VAT of 5%. Alternatively, service providers — typically UAE residents — and NRI relatives and associates of the Indians in questions set up company in Dubai to receive funds. Subsequently, Indian residents — who were behind the transactions — bought out these UAE shareholders to acquire the Dubai company (that was holding the laundered money). \"There will be some amount of disruption in UAE starting Jan 2018. Considering that UAE has been blacklisted by EU, all steps are being taken to comply very seriously with various guidelines. There is increase in the cost of doing business in UAE by 5-10% for every transaction which does make UAE lose some of its competitive advantage. This will impact transactions of all kinds,\" said Mitil Chokshi, senior partner at chartered accountant firm Chokshi & Chokshi. According to senior chartered accountant Dilip Lakhani, \"Besides higher cost of operations on account of VAT, entities in Dubai will be forced to maintain regular books of accounts. This will enable UAE authorities to monitor their activities and track the transaction trail. Till the time other creative and ingenious ways are discovered, VAT can go a long way in curbing money laundering.\" In obfuscating the money flow, launderers typically floated a chain of companies in Dubai: for instance company A which receives funds initially transfers the money to another Dubai company B on the back of some transaction and false invoices; B in turn enters into a similar deal with C; once the fund is booked as earnings with C, companies A and B are shut down to eliminate the trail. This will no longer be possible as VAT registration and tax payment records of A and B would remain even if the companies cease to exist. Also, VAT will be levied every time money moves from one entity to another. Money launderers may try to overcome the VAT hurdle by setting up shop in UAEs designated free trade zones where there is exemption from the tax. But, this would require such entities to deal only with counterparties which are spared from VAT. It may not be easy to stay entirely off the radar as some transactions like payment of rent, fee to accountants, or other expenditures could be subject to VAT. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) — comprising UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar — have decided to introduce VAT. While UAE is gearing up to levy it from January 1, 2018 at rate of 5%, other GCC members plan to bring in VAT a year later. The new tax regime in UAE comes at a point when Indian authorities are asking companies to spell out details — such as names, ultimate beneficiary, fund source — of foreign direct investors.','BUSINESS-INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS','Sugata Ghosh','2017-12-15 12:20:00','| ET Bureau | Updated: Dec 15, 2017, 12:20 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:36'),(73,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/aviation-minister-flight-delay-air-india-chief-to-meet-senior-airline-officials/articleshow/62066826.cms','Aviation minister flight delay: Air India chief to meet senior airline officials','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62066885,width-400,resizemode-4/62066885.jpg]','NEW DELHI: Air India CMD Pradeep Singh Kharola has called for a meeting of senior officials after a flight carrying Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju was unduly delayed at the airport here, airline sources said.

Albeit, economic stalwart like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon calling it a \"fraud\", digital assets and platforms growing in numbers suggest the contrary. Bitcoin is the worlds first and most popular form of virtual currency that allowed people to buy products and services in exchange of money without really involving banks. Not just Bitcoin, other cryptocurrency platforms which followed the trend provide similar add-ons if not more. Litecoin started its journey in October 2011, two years after the rolling out of Bitcoin. The basics of virtual currency remain the same with Litecoin to the extent that they are both open source platforms. Mining holds the key for generating cryptocurrency for both. Litecoin has the extra yard in terms of generation time for a block. While Litecoin takes 2.5 minutes for creating, bitcoin makes the user wait four times longer. The quicker operation of Litecoin can be attributed to the simpler Scrypt algorithm as opposed to Bitcoins SHA-256 algorithm. Scrypt favours huge volume of high speed RAM, thus giving Litecoin the edge. On the outset, both deal in cryptocurrency, but Bitcoin and Litecoin differ in the total number of coins that can be traded with. The Bitcoin network has a transaction limit of 21 million coins, whereas the Litecoin allows 84 million coins. Cryptocurrency usage is overwhelmingly gaining worldwide acceptance. Longer stint in the market has certainly helped Bitcoin to remain on top of the ladder but the volatile dynamics of digital market remains the silver lining for Litecoin.','BUSINESS-INDIA-BUSINESS','Anirban Mitra','2017-12-16 12:57:00','| TIMESOFINDIA.COM | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 12:57 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:37'),(75,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ficci-meet-state-fms-speak-on-gst-implementation-bringing-petrol-under-its-ambit/articleshow/62079175.cms','Ficci meet: State FMs speak on GST implementation, bringing petrol under its ambit','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62079675,width-400,resizemode-4/62079675.jpg]','NEW DELHI: The annual meet of industry body Ficci saw at least one of the state finance ministers expressing concern over the implementation of GST (Goods and Services Tax). West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra said that unpreparedness and hasty implementation (of GST) have resulted not only in revenue loss but also hit small and medium enterprises (SMEs) hard. Mitra who has previously served as the secretary general of Ficci also raised the issue of the inconsistent revenues generated by GST. \"The hasty manner, in which GST was rolled out, had taken a huge toll on the revenue collections,\" he said. The revenue collections in October were Rs 83,346 crore, significantly down from the September figure of Rs 95,131 crore. He further pointed out that the reduction in the GST collection could have implication on the compensation to states adding that the states need Rs 1.72 lakh crore for the first four months for revenue protection. About Rs 1.33 lakh crore has been compensated to states in the first four months, and there is a shortfall of Rs 39,111 crore, Mitra said. Mitra however, was rebutted by Jammu and Kashmir finance minister Haseeb Drabu who said these were still early days and it would be unfair to judge the GST system just yet. \"Give it another three to four months. If the government and the GST Council are as responsive as they have been, what we have in the making is a robust GST which works for business, the central government and the states,\" he said. In another session, Bihar finance minister Sushil Modi said that the GST Council will consider bringing electricity, petroleum products and some other items under the ambit of GST in future. \"Electricity, real estate, stamp duty and petroleum products should become part of GST (Goods and Services Tax). This would be our (GST Council) endeavour,\" he said. Chalking out a possible mechanism to bring fuel products under the GST ambit, Modi said petroleum products will attract the highest tax slab prevalent at that time (currently 28 per cent) and states would be at liberty to levy cess on it in order to protect their revenues. Both states and the Centre earn 40 per cent of their revenue from petroleum products at present.','BUSINESS-INDIA-BUSINESS','','2017-12-15 11:35:00','TIMESOFINDIA.COM | Dec 15, 2017, 11:35 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:37'),(76,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japan-firm-says-it-will-pay-part-of-salaries-in-bitcoin/articleshow/62080766.cms','Japan firm says it will pay part of salaries in Bitcoin','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62080771,width-400,resizemode-4/62080771.jpg]','TOKYO: A Japanese company will start paying part of its employees salaries in Bitcoin, as it aims to get better understanding of the virtual currency, a spokeswoman said on Friday.

It said the panic among the bank depositors has arisen largely due to \"bail-in\" provisions in the FRDI Bill, cautioning that the trust in the banking system runs the risk of being eroded if the clause is not done way with. The draft bill envisages a Resolution Corporation which would prevent banks from going bankrupt by \"writing down of the liabilities\", a phrase some have interpreted as a \"bail in\". Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday said the government is working to protect interest of bank customers and their deposits, as he sought to dispel rumours regarding the proposed FRDI Bill. \"The governments assurance notwithstanding, Sub-section 7 of Section 52 of the proposed law clearly says that the bail-in, to which depositors have strong objection to, shall not be applicable to deposits to the extent only covered by insurance,\" said the chamber. In a statement, it said the intention seems to be that it should not always be the government which should take a hit for the bail-out of a bank in trouble; and let the shareholders and other stakeholders, which include even the depositors (above the limit of insured amount) be responsible for saving a financial entity. \"Now as of now, the deposits are covered only up to Rs one lakh, which is a measly sum for millions of middle class families which have kept their life time savings in bank deposits,\" it said. Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said in the Indian context, the concept of \"bail-in\" especially by depositors should be completely done away with and their monies in the banks have to be protected at any cost. \"Otherwise, the trust in the banking system runs the risk of being eroded and the savings by the households would find way into unproductive avenues like real estate, gold, jewellery and even in the unorganised and informal financial markets run by unscrupulous people,\" he said. He said the middle class families and especially the pensioners and other old-aged people have no social security and the bank deposits are their only financial security. The so-called \"bail-in\" clause in the draft Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, 2017 has been commented upon by experts as bringing potential harm to deposits, in the form of savings accounts. The draft law, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in August, is currently undergoing scrutiny by a joint parliamentary committee. The FRDI Bill proposes to create a framework for overseeing financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, non-banking financial services (NBFC) companies and stock exchanges in case of insolvency. The Resolution Corporation, proposed in the draft bill, would look after the process and prevent the banks from going bankrupt. It would do this by \"writing down of the liabilities\", a phrase some have interpreted as a \"bail in\". The draft bill empowers Resolution Corporation to cancel the liability of a failing bank or convert the nature of the liability.','BUSINESS-INDIA-BUSINESS','','2017-12-14 17:25:00','PTI | Dec 14, 2017, 17:25 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:39'),(79,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/eyeing-1-trillion-in-digital-business-government-works-on-a-new-electronics-policy/articleshow/62073472.cms','Eyeing $1 trillion in digital business, government works on a new electronics policy','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62073547,width-400,resizemode-4/62073547.jpg]','NEW DELHI: A new electronics manufacturing policy is on the anvil and work is also on for rolling out an upgraded software products architecture as the government lays down measures to boost Indias digital economy to $1 trillion over the coming years.

Fruits of rapid economic growth, which the state has been experiencing for many years, is not being wasted on a bad habit\", Kumar said counting virtues of alcohol ban. \"Social evils must be targeted if we do not wish to fritter away the benefits of economic progress. That is why we did not stop at prohibition and launched a campaign against child marriage and dowry. Child marriage is detrimental to the health of women and leads to diseased and stunted progeny. The anxiety of arranging dowry often leads parents to marry off their daughters at a young age,\" the chief minister said. \"I urge all people to boycott such wedding ceremonies where dowry is taken. The parties concerned will feel ashamed and isolated and set an example before others. I have myself made it clear that I would not attend any marriage function where it is not stated clearly on the invitation cards that the ceremony will be performed without any dowry\", he said. Besides economic growth and the aforesaid social reform measures, the government is committed to maintaining communal harmony. Many people believe communal harmony is all about giving sermons. But it is an ideal that has to be lived, Kumar said in an obvious dig at Prasad. Earlier, Kumar visited Kamalpur village in Darbhanga district where he awarded a memento to Rinki Kumari, a 14-year-old girl who resisted her parents attempt to get her married at the tender age. The chief minister today completed the first phase of his state-wide \"Vikas Samiksha Yatra\".','CITY-PATNA','','2017-12-16 19:06:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 19:06 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:43'),(84,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/munger-stinks-as-sanitation-staff-stir-on/articleshow/62089092.cms','Munger stinks as sanitation staff stir on','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62093945,width-400,resizemode-4/62093945.jpg]','MUNGER: Garbage and civic problems seem to be mounting for Munger town residents as the indefinite strike by 275 sanitation workers of the area entered its fifth day on Friday.

To provide confirmed tickets to all passengers in each class, the sources said, it was contemplated to run an identical train for spillover bookings. The only condition was that the spillover bookings should be enough to justify the run of an additional train with the same load combination. The average number of berths in different classes in a full-load train is around 700. The Railway Board had agreed in principle to run duplicate trains to clear the rush of passengers during festivals. However, the authorities later developed cold feet as they found the Up and Down tracks fully saturated with goods and passenger trains both running on the same tracks. \"Running identical trains every day on the routes already congested was not advisable,\" a railway official said.

About 90,000 of them can be treated at NRCs, but there is no targeted strategy for the remaining 26 lakh children. There were approximately 1.9 crore children under 6 years of age in the state as per the 2011 Census. The figure was highlighted at a workshop titled Samvardhan — A comprehensive action against under-nutrition in Bihar, which was inaugurated by health minister Mangal Pandey. The workshop, organized by State Health Society Bihar, Centre for Excellence in the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and UNICEF, stressed the need of community involvement for the management of nutrition among young children in Bihar. Citing National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4 data, nutrition specialist from Unicefs India office Abner Daniels said there has been a downfall in malnutrition cases in Bihar, but the pace is still slow to meet the 2025 target set by the Centre for its elimination. \"If anganwadi centres (AWC) are involved in screening severe acute malnutrition (SAM) cases with the help of Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC), that may give us a chance to intervene at a very basic and ground level,\" he said. It was found that boys below 24 months of age and girls are at higher risk of becoming SAM cases. \"There is already facility-based care in Bihar for such cases. The need is to provide a community-based care. Prevention of SAM cases, as well as treatment, should be the prime focus. Targeted action should be taken in cases with high probability of becoming SAM cases,\" he added. \"AWCs should be made the centre of excellence instead of an NRC. This will increase awareness in terms of preventive measures taken and counselling of the parents with the doorstep service provided by the AWC. We need to strengthen the monitoring system of malnutrition cases in the state,\" said UNICEF programme manager Shivendra Nath Pandeya. State programme officer of Child Health, Dr Surendra Kumar, said it was observed that the most severe wasting (malnourished) cases occurred in scheduled castes and tribes. \"Nutrition is still not a priority for the general masses. The 38 NRCs have 40% to 50% occupancy only. Since 2011, the state has treated nearly 41,449 children at the NRCs,\" he said. Six NRCs were proposed in medical colleges. \"Three of these have already been set up at NMCH, PMCH and DMCH,\" he said, but added that the one at DMCH was not running well. SAM cases can also be diagnosed by assessing children for visible severe wasting, defined as the presence of muscle wasting in the gluteal region, loss of subcutaneous fat or prominence of bony structures, particularly over the thorax. SAM differs from chronic malnutrition, which manifests as stunting.','CITY-PATNA','Ayesha Hassan','2017-12-16 12:22:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 12:22 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:46'),(90,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/cm-opens-lays-stones-of-schemes-worth-rs-686cr/articleshow/62089541.cms','Nitish Kumar opens, lays stones of schemes worth Rs 686 crore','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62093692,width-400,resizemode-4/62093692.jpg]','MADHUBANI/PATNA:Chief minister Nitish Kumar inaugurated and laid stones of 523 development schemes worth Rs 686 crore in north Bihars two villages which he visited during his Vikas Sameeksha Yatra on Friday.

There are 65,000 sanitation workers in the three corporations, around 60% of whom are permanent employees, the rest being casual workers. While the latter are angered that they get less than half the salary paid to the regular workers, the permanent employees are incensed at the non-payment of arrears since 2003 and the lack of other facilities such as cashless medical cards. AAP councillor Vikas Goyal briefly sat on a dharna during the standing committee meeting in the north body on Monday, charging the panel with not having serious discussions on the issue. Leader of the opposition Rakesh Kumar held a meeting with union representatives. Six days of strike have left east Delhi reeking. On Monday, the impact of the strike in the other municipalities was visible in Civil Lines, Karol Bagh, Narela, Rohini and City zone in the north and in Najafgarh and west zones in the south. \"The main road near Krishna Nagar was overflowing with garbage today,\" grumbled B S Vohra of the RWAs Federation of East Delhi. The efforts of Dr Ranbir Singh, EDMC commissioner, to talk things out with the striking workers failed. His warning of no work, no pay also failed to end the strike. \"Having disbursed bonus to all the workers on Monday, we hope they will return to work,\" said Singh after the civic body received Rs 108 crore as grant from Delhi government during the day. However, Gahlot insisted, \"We are not satisfied with just the bonus. We are in no mood to end the strike.\" The south corporation has disbursed the bonus to its sanitation workers and the north body has announced the bonus. \"We have paid the arrears and the bonus asnd we also pay their salaries on time, so there is no reason for workers going on strike. Regularisation of the casual workers is a long process and are doing our homework on it,\" said SDMC mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat. At a meeting with Union urban development minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Monday, north corporation mayor Preety Agrawal flagged the financial crunch in the civic body. By evening, officials had met representatives of the striking workers. \"In the meeting, the workers said would take a call on the strike on Tuesday,\" a senior official said. Agrawal also disclosed that the ministry has given Rs 100 crore to each of the three corporations to buy machinery.','CITY-DELHI','AlokKNMishra','2017-10-17 10:24:00','| tnn | Updated: Oct 17, 2017, 10:24 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:51'),(98,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/man-held-at-delhi-airport-for-smuggling-gold-worth-rs-27-lakh/articleshow/60246623.cms','Man held at Delhi airport for smuggling gold worth Rs 27 lakh','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-60246615,width-400,resizemode-4/60246615.jpg]','NEW DELHI: A man was arrested at the airport here by the Customs Department for allegedly trying to smuggle in gold worth Rs 27 lakh, officials said.

Her kidneys were transplanted to them, making this perhaps the first case in the world where organs have been harvested from a patient in spite of poisoning and cardiac death, Dr Anup Kumar, professor and head, department of urology and renal transplantation at Safdarjung hospital, said. On Tuesday, a minor argument with her parents drove Shakuntala, the eldest daughter of Mukesh Pandit, a resident of Chhattarpur in South Delhi, to attempt suicide. She consumed insecticide kept at home. It led to vomiting and decreased level of consciousness. By the time her parents rushed the Class XII student to Safdarjung hospital, her condition turned serious. The poison affected blood supply to the brain and she was declared brain dead on Wednesday. Transplant coordinators approached the parents seeking permission for organ do nation, Kumar, also the nodal officer for organ transplant at Safdarjung hospital, said. Shakuntalas parents, still in a state of shock, gave their consent. One of the recipients, a 39 year-old woman, was on dialysis at Safdarjung hospital for three years after her kidney failed. \"She wont have lived for more than two years without the transplant. Shakuntala gave her a new lease of life,\" Kumar said. The other kidney transplant took place at Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. Shakuntalas heart could not be used because by the time AIIM doctors could come to harvest it, the organ had failed. Her liver was also rendered useless as it was affected by poisoning. Shakuntalas father, still in a state of shock yet proud that she saved two lives in death, told TOI: \"She always stood first in class. We were so sure she would make us proud one day but then this tragedy happened.\" He said police helped in speeding up the process of harvesting and transplanting the organs. Over two lakh Indians require transplantation, not even 10% get it.This is because few people have the courage to put aside their grief and agree for donating the organs of their dear ones, once they have been confirmed brain dead or dead. Spain has had a donor rate over 34 per million people. A number of other major countries have donation rates of 20-30 per million people including France, Italy, and the USA. The current rate of organ donation from the brain dead is 0.08 per million people, officials said. At a basic level, we must first start with creating more awareness about organ donation and why it is needed, says Dr Anupam Sibal, the group medical director of Apollo hospital. \"Most people do not know about the concept of brain death or how retrieval of organs from such patients can help save lives. When they are told about it when their kin is brain dead, they react with shock. They often refuse to participate,\" Sibal said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Mann Ki Baat radio address to the nation in October 2015 urged people to donate organs, and said it was the most vital donation one could think of.\"What could be a bigger donation than this?\" PM Modi asked. As a result, union health minister J P Nadda later informed Rajya Sabha, average number of visitors visiting to the National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation (NOTTO) website everyday increased from 665 before Mann Ki Baat on October 25, 2015 to 1,407, and similarly, average number of calls being received has increased from 22 to 61 per day. Dr Sibal said more celebrities and senior politicians should follow the PMs initiative and urge people to donate organs.

The citys fashionistas have always complained about how Kolkata doesnt make room for a drastic new look. However, keeping the non-experimental tag aside, the city is experiencing a new trend -hair tattoos -as made famous by international footballers like Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Pogba and many others. Hair tattooing is not just a trend; it is a style statement that many are going gaga about. Styling of hair is the easiest way to change your look. But how much can you experiment with hair? Hair stylist Md Sajid said, \"You can be very creative with your hair. At our salon, we mostly see young people coming for hair tattoos and it is becoming popular gradually.\" Drummer and fitness enthusiast Nikita Chowdhury went for a hair tattoo recently and she feels that experi menting with hair is her forte. She said, \"I love to modify my look. I feel my look makes me feel stronger. If I didnt have the hair colour and style of my own, I wouldnt be as confident as I am today .I will never stop experimenting, no matter what.\" Dancer Sudarshan Chakraborty has made his hair tattoo a style statement of his own. He said, \"I did it in 2004. Initially, it was such a new and fresh style that people used to stare at me wondering what I had done to my hair.\" He also said the style has become a boon. \"If I talk about the styling, I must say it has become my signature style and I believe it brought me good luck. This particu lar style also gave a new look to my balding hairline. I had very low selfesteem because I was balding. This entire styling, or what you call a hair tattoo, transformed me as a person... I became more confident as a performer,\" he said. When asked about maintenance, Chakraborty said, \"I have a stylist and he takes care of it.Hair tattoo isnt like a body tattoo that you do once and it will be like that forever. You need to trim and maintain it properly . The best part is that you can be very creative with it. You can change it whenever you want.\" Anwesha Sarkar, a fashion designing student from FDDI, also had a hair tattoo done recently . Sarkar came across the trend on Pinterest first. She said, \"Since I am a fashion student, I need to keep track of what is trending globally . I came across this style and it really looked very interesting. The one that I have done lets me wear my hair both with and without the tattoo.\" She thinks experimentation is the key to gaining confidence. \"The more you experiment, the more confident you become about yourself,\" she said. She also thinks Kolkata is becoming cooler with time. \"Many have come up to me and appreciated my style, but many have also stared at me with disgust. The disgusted look comes mostly from the older generation. But the younger crowd has appreciated the styling a lot,\" she added. Actor Joyraj Bhattacharjee said he opted for a hair tattoo just to flout the norms. He said, \"Since I do theatre, I dont get much chance to experiment with my looks. Bengali theatre has its own definition of what is cul tured and what is not. So, I experiment with my look whenever I get a chance. I like to disregard rules that are already set.\" Chirasree Bandopadhyay, a freelance writer, also went for a hair tattoo once and feels that she is done with the look. She said, \"I did it once and I think I am done. I loved the look but since I like experimenting, I think I will go for some other look next time.\" When asked about how the experience of sporting a hair tattoo was, she said, \"I loved it. It escalates your confidence level to a new height and I am happy that I did it once. Sporting a hair tattoo made me realise that I can pull off any kind of style.\" — Shrutanwita Chakraborty','ENTERTAINMENT-BENGALI','','2017-07-27 13:07:00','TNN | Jul 27, 2017, 13:07 IST','2017-12-16 19:14:59'),(104,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sundars-book-at-centre-of-controversy-at-du-meet/articleshow/59292489.cms','Sundar’s book at centre of controversy at DU meet','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59292797,width-400,resizemode-4/59292797.jpg]','NEW DELHI: There was some ruckus at Delhi Universitys academic council meeting when members of the National Democratic Teachers Front opposed the inclusion of three chapters of sociologist Nandini Sundars book, The Burning Forest: Indias War in Bastar, in the suggested reading list of Political Sociology.

On a committee being set up to reconsider the book, Sundar said she was not worried. \"They can set up a committee and try finding problematic content in the book.\" Coming to support of Sundar were many AC members who opposed the objections raised by the NDTF.

Away from the spotlight though, two varieties of home-grown rice too bagged the prestigious stamp that may prove commercially more crucial. Gobindobhog and Tulaipanji, two varieties of aromatic rice — one from south Bengal and the other from north — were quietly granted the GI certificate on October 24. A GI is primarily an agricultural, natural or a manufactured product (handicrafts and industrial goods) originating from a definite geographical territory. The tag ensures none other than those authorised are allowed to use the product name. The coveted tag for the two rice varieties could potentially open up new export opportunities for the state. Gobindobhog is currently exported in small quantities to UAE, the UK and the US where it is consumed by non-resident Bengalis. Gobindobhog, that was originally cultivated in Burdwans Raina and Khandoghosh and is now grown in seven more districts, has been a favourite in Bengali homes for generations and offered to both guests and Gods. From plain bhaat to bhog or khichuri to payesh, Gobindobhog clearly scores over the fancied Basmati in Bengals homes. The rice variety derives its name from Lord Krishna to whom the rice was offered dur-ing religious ceremonies. Tulaipanji, on the other hand, has been popular in only pockets of the state and came into prominence only in recent years with the government undertaking its promotion. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been its foremost brand ambassador, presenting packets of the rice to guests at home and hosts during her trips abroad. According to Prof DD Patra, vice-chancellor of Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya (BCKV) that played a key role in the GI application, both rice varieties could explore opportunities in all countries where rice is part of the staple diet. \"Now BCKV can export both rice verities as it is the sole authority for production of seeds of the two rice varieties,\" the VC said. He hoped the state agriculture marketing department would soon give its nod for exports. While BCKV is the patent facilitator for both the varieties of rice, Uttar Banga Krishi Viswavidyalaya played the lead role for Tulaipanji. An official of the patent information centre of science and technology department said the state government had applied for GI of Gobindobhog and Tulaipanji on August 24, 2015 and it had been granted on August 28, 2017. The certificates were issued on October 24. The GI registration will emain valid till August 23, 2025 for both rice varieties. Gobindobhog is a non-basmati indigenous, aromatic rice of Bengal grown in Burdwan for the past 300 years. It has short white kernels with a good cooking quality and pleasant aroma. It is mainly cultivated during kharif season in East Burdwan, Hooghly, Howrah, Nadia, North 24-Parganas, Birbhum, Bankura and Murshidabad. BCKV is also trying to grow Gobindobhog organically at Sagar in South 24-Parganas, for export. Gobindobhog that sells in Kolkata for Rs 70-85 a kg is also popular in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Bengals exclusive aromatic rice variety Tulaipanji which was also granted the much coveted GI tag is priced in city markets around Rs 100 a kg. \"This recognition will help rice-growers of North Dinajpur to increase productivity for new markets that are expected to open up as it becomes more popular,\" an official said. Tulaipanji rice, finds its mention in a Sanskrit scripture of 1300 AD. The name is derived from a Bengali word meaning aromatic and soft like cotton. It can retain the aroma for a year. The cooked rice is whitish-yellow, slender, non-sticky and tasty. The rice is excellent for preparation of pulao, fried rice and biryani. Another distinct feature of the rice is its disease-pest resistance. Tulaipanji is cultivated only in North Dinajpurs Hemtabad, Raigunj and Kaliagunj and is known as Basmati of north Bengal. Agriculture minister Ashis Banerjee said that this GI tag will surely help the farmers producing both the varieties of rice and hoped the states rice export will grow.','CITY-KOLKATA','','2017-11-16 06:31:00','tnn | Updated: Nov 16, 2017, 06:31 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:00'),(106,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bullet-from-the-blue-there-could-be-a-cartridge-in-your-baggage/articleshow/59292462.cms','Bullet mystery has officials at IGI stumped','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59293991,width-400,resizemode-4/59293991.jpg]','NEW DELHI: Ramandeep Singh, Jagjit Singh Dhillon and Rahul Kant Singh may have never seen — or met — each other. However, they have a connection, or so it may seem. They are among the scores of people who are under police lens for having been caught with a bullet in their check-in baggage at Indira Gandhi International Airport. The mystery of these passengers carrying just one bullet — with no idea of where it came from — has stumped officials. Every month, around five people have been found carrying a single bullet in their baggage. Interestingly, while these passengers are from different corners of the world, a majority of the bullets have KF engraved at the base signifying the ordnance factory where they were made. Also inscribed on the bullets are the letters S&W and the digits 32, referring to the model, Smith & Wesson, and firearm calibre, according to the FIRs lodged in the cases. Security and airport officials say the first few digits of the serial number in cartridges are usually the same with unique digits at the end. In most case, the bullets were detected during X-ray screening in the check-in baggage of passengers headed abroad. CISF and airport officials, however, arent sure if there is some foul play involved. \"Most of the individuals belong to the army or paramilitary forces and may have accidentally carried a cartridge or live round in their baggage. We follow protocol and hand them over to police for action,\" said a senior CISF officer. Ramandeep Singh (22), for example, was headed for Malaysia on June 17 when the airline security was alerted about a bullet in his check-in baggage. He was promptly offloaded from the flight. The live cartridge had \"KF 32 S&W L\" engraved on it. Singh, however, was clueless about how the bullet landed in his luggage. Similarly, 27-year-old Dhillon was travelling to London on an Air India flight when a bullet, with KF 32 S&W L etched on the bottom, was found in his check-in luggage. In his complaint, an airport security officer said he had got a call from DIAL security to escort the passenger to level 4 after the cartridge was detected in his bag. In another case, Rahul Kant Singh was flying to Pune on a Spice Jet flight on June 17 when he was offloaded for having a bullet marked \"32 S&W L\" in his bag. Airport and CISF officers admitted that of the 5-7 cases of bullets being detected in baggage every month, it was mostly army or paramilitary forces personnel who admitted to mistakenly carrying a live round. Generally, shooters and military personnel have documents that authorise them to possess bullets. However, most of them carry one or multiple cartridges, rather than a single bullet. An FIR is registered only when a person is unable to account for the bullets. In the above cases too, the FIRs were registered after the passengers couldnt justify why they were in possession of live ammunition. A senior police officer said an FIR under Section 25 of the Arms Act was lodged in such cases.','CITY-DELHI','Raj Shekhar','2017-06-24 05:35:00','| TNN | Updated: Jun 24, 2017, 05:35 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:01'),(107,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/vikram-chatterjee-granted-bail-in-sonika-chauhan-death-case/articleshow/59786992.cms','Vikram Chatterjee granted bail in Sonika Chauhan death case','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59786992,width-400,resizemode-4/59786992.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/59787554/Master.jpg]','After spending 18 days in judicial custody, actor Vikram Chatterjee was granted bail by Additional District Judge Sujay Sengupta of Alipore court yesterday in the Sonika Chauhan death case.

Initially, he was only booked under Section 304 A (death due to negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which is bailable. But police later slapped non-bailable section 304 (culpable homicide) against the actor citing proof that substantiated the theory of over-speeding. \"The court has granted him bail on a personal bond of Rs 50,000 with one surety of the same amount.

The rain caught everyone unawares as it drenched the city a day in advance. According to the prediction, Kolkata was supposed to remain cloudy on Wednesday and receive light to moderate showers on Thursday. Kolkata received 19mm rain till 5.30pm on Wednesday. The rest of south Bengal, too, received a steady drizzle. On Wednesday morning, the depression stood 460km south-west of Gopalpur and 210km south-east of Machhlipatnam, according to G K Das, director, Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). According to the IMD, the depression is likely to move in a northward direction initially and maintain its intensity over the next 24 hours. It is then predicted to move north-northeastwards and weaken gradually. \"It intensified earlier than we had expected and triggered showers a day in advance. The rain could turn heavier on Thursday and stop by Friday afternoon,\" said Das. It will be raining in the rest of south Bengal as well, with the coastal areas receiving heavier showers, he added. It rained across south Bengal with coastal areas in West Midnapore and South 24 Parganas receiving heavy showers. It will continue to rain on Thursday with a wind speed of up to 50 km/hr, according to the IMD. A warning has been issued for fishermen since the sea condition is expected to be rough to very rough along and off the West Bengal coast during the next 48 hours. The steady drizzle that started early on Wednesday morning and continued through the day raised the spectre of a spurt in dengue cases. Experts pointed out that the light showers could lead to a proliferation of fresh water collections — an ideal breeding ground for dengue mosquitoes. As the system moves northward from Odisha coast, showers will get heavier in Kolkata, said the RMC. \"The rain is set to get heavier in the city from late on Wednesday night. We are still expecting the showers to remain moderate, but heavier than the steady drizzle that drenched Kolkata on Wednesday. The weather should start improving by Friday morning, with the drizzle turning sporadic and gradually disappearing by late afternoon,\" said Das.','CITY-KOLKATA','','2017-11-16 06:23:00','tnn | Updated: Nov 16, 2017, 06:23 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:03'),(110,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/daughter-son-in-law-arrested-for-murdering-68-year-old-widow-in-kolkata/articleshow/60247501.cms','Daughter, son-in-law arrested for murdering 68-year-old widow in Kolkata','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-60247502,width-400,resizemode-4/60247502.jpg]','KOLKATA: The daughter and son-in-law of the 68-year-old Shipra Bhattacharya, who was found dead under mysterious circumstances at her Behala home on Saturday were arrested on charges of murdering the old woman and allegedly forging a suicide note, that police suspect was written on a page from ladys grandsons school notebook. Police said, Kaberi Bhattacharya (37) and her husband Anupam (41) confessed to have strangulated the woman and smothered her to death before hanging her body with a ceiling fan in an attempt to pass off the death as a suicide. The reason - the widow had allegedly refused to part with the money she got from her husbands pension to meet the monthly expenses of the couple. Acting on a complaint lodged by Sujay Krishna Bhadra, the younger brother of the elderly woman, police questioned the Kaberi and her husband for long hours through Saturday as their statements often differed. They could not explain the reason why their mother was depressed, their own movements hours before the death of their mother and why their mother will bolt one door while trying to commit suicide but keep the other two open.

The department seeks to bring speakers of tribal languages and analyse their speech directly at the centre, said T Muthukrishnan, head of the linguistics department.

Talking to TOI, he said more than 30 peacocks visit the fields daily and they live off the crops and grains the farmers raise in the fields. Recently, a muster of 20 peacocks had damaged crops in nearly five acres of farmland in Punjaipuliyampatty. The farmers faced a loss of nearly Rs 2 lakh in the peacock raid. According to farmers, the human-peacock conflict has intensified at Punjaipuliyampatty and its surrounding villages. \"The peacock population has increased and we are feeling the pinch as they often raid our crops, causing us huge financial loss,\" said S Sivasubramaniam, another villager. The peacocks stray into the village from the nearby reserve forest. \"The officials are not willing to chase the bird away as it is our national bird and listed under the prevention of wildlife act,\" the farmers said.','CITY-COIMBATORE','','2017-12-16 10:51:00','TNN | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 10:51 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:14'),(124,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/tasmac-bar-worker-killed-by-customers/articleshow/62090635.cms','Tasmac bar worker killed by customers','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62093287,width-400,resizemode-4/62093287.jpg]','Tirupur: A 28-year-old Tasmac bar worker was killed by three customers in a quarrel in the city on Friday.

Attributed to a number of causes like low returns and lack of skilled labour, the profession of earthen pot making is losing business to terracotta clay pots that are manufactured in the outskirts of the city or in districts like Solapur. In the past, most kumbhars or potters from the city had their own workshops where they manufactured various articles including drinking water pots, flower pots, small and big lamps as well as an assortment of utensils using clay. These items were brought to their own outlets in the market for to be sold. While the shops continue to remain, a number of goods are being imported from large scale manufacturers of terracotta clay articles around the city and other parts of the state. Potter Azar Kumbhar of National Matka Bhandar pointed out that earthenware is in demand during particular seasons. \"While earthen water pots and flower pots are sold around the year, other items are mainly in demand during the festive season. Earthen lamps or diyas are popular during Diwali, Ghata or Navaratra pots are sold during Navaratra and special decorated wedding pots are in demand around wedding seasons. These seasons are our main source of revenue,\" he stated.

He added that due to the effort and skill that goes into pottery and the meagre returns, the younger generation is moving away from the family business. Azar shared a similar story. An event manager by profession, he took over the reins of the business after his fathers demise two years ago. \"My generation wants to pursue a career instead of working at the shop. My family has been running this store since 1920, when my grandmother would make pots at home and sell them here. My uncle is still involved in pottery and makes small items. However, there is not much left in the business. Only two per cent youngsters from traditional Kumbhar families are engaged in it.

The civic officials plan to hold discussions with the agencies interested and will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with those found to be eligible. The PMC has said that the bicycles are expected to be funded and operated by the appointed agency. According to PMC, the city currently has a 94km network of cycle tracks. It has proposed to develop another 824km, with 798 cycle parking stations across the city, in the next three years. The PMC had allotted Rs80 crore for the cycle plan in its first year, but repurposed Rs10 crore. It will now spend Rs70 crore on the plan.

A day before the general body meeting, the mayor, along with senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, had called a meeting of party corporators to discuss the policy. A discussion on the policy was also expected in the general body, however, the opposition protested the earlier meeting, demanding that a presentation be held for all parties. The ensuing chaos ruled out any discussion, and the policy was approved by a majority vote. However, the opposition parties — Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Congress and Shiv Sena — submitted a letter to the municipal secretary, claiming that voting on the proposal was held in an improper manner at the general body meeting and so, the proposal should be reconsidered. The parties have also approached municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar to block the implementation of the policy till it is discussed by the general body.

In her emotionally-charged speech, she recalled the times when she entered politics after losing her anchor (husband Rajiv Gandhi) and mother (Indira Gandhi), and how with the support of crores of Congress workers she steered the party to power both at the Centre and in many states. She said since 2014, the Congress has been playing the role of an opposition, saying \"never before have we faced the challenge that we face today\". \"The fundamentals of our Constitution are under attack. Our party has lost several state elections. But an exemplary energy fires our Congress workers. We are not the ones to bend in fear, because our struggle is a fight for the very soul of this nation. We will never retreat from this fight,\" she said. She said party leaders and workers today are custodians of ideals and principles on which the nation was built. World when Sonia Gandhi became Congress president in 1998 Sonia Gandhi has been the Congress president for nineteen years - the longest in the history of the 132-year-old party. Here’s a look at how different India and the world were when she took over. \"This is no small matter. It is not power, wealth or self-importance that is our aim, it is this country -- it is safeguarding our fundamental principles,\" she said. Congratulating Rahul Gandhi on his elevation, she said personal attacks on him have made him fearless and voiced confidence his leadership would infuse new vigour in the party. \"I am confident that with a new and young leadership, our party will be reinvigorated and bring about changes we need. You have chosen Rahul as your leader. He is my son, and it is not right for me to praise him. \"But I will say - from his very childhood he has borne the experience of violence, the savage personal attacks he has confronted since entering politics has served to make him a brave and fearless man. I am proud of his endurance and firmness, and am confident he will lead the party with a pure heart, courage, patience and devotion,\" she said.

Soon after a formal certificate was handed over to Rahul Gandhi on becoming the Congress president, she hoped he would lead the party with courage and dedication. She said she was proud of her sons endurance and determination. At one point when Rahul rose to speak, he sought his mothers blessings and kissed her on the forehead. Sonia Gandhi, who headed the 132-year-old Congress for the last 19 years, also thanked party leaders and workers for the support she had received during her tenure as its chief. During the speech, she also talked about the time when she was reluctant to join politics following the assassination of her mother-in-law Indira Gandhi and husband Rajiv Gandhi, but said she had to step in after a call from partymen as \"communal forces were gaining strength.\" \"I thought that if I did not join politics, Indira ji and my husband would have felt bad and their sacrifice would go waste,\" she said. As she relinquished charge of the partys top post, she admitted that when she took over the responsibility, \"I was so nervous and my hands were trembling\".

Striking a personal note, she said Rahul has faced a lot of criticism from the Opposition ever since he made his debut in national politics, but all these things has only boosted her sons endurance and determination. \"Rahul is my son, so I do not think for me to praise him is right but I would say that since childhood he had to bear the brunt of violence and after joining politics, he had to face blatant personal attacks that have made him a stronger person,\" she said. In his first speech to party workers after formally assuming charge as the Congress president, Rahul said he took over the party reins knowing that he would always be walking in the \"shadow of giants\". Sonias legacy endures in the face of this epochal change in Indias Grand Old Party. Initially loath to join politics after witnessing the assassination of her mother-in-law Indira Gandhi and husband Rajiv Gandhi while theyd both been serving as prime minister, Sonia went on to helm Congress for a record-breaking 19 years. Under her stewardship, the Congress led the Centre for two terms from 2004 to 2014 and returned to power in a host of states. The then party president achieved this by successfully stitching electoral alliances with other political parties. When she nominated Manmohan Singh as the prime minister, her standing went up by several notches. Her supporters called it an act of sacrifice while some saw it as a political masterstroke. After several bouts of illness over the last two years, Sonias abrupt announcement to \"retire\" caused a flutter on Friday. Congress leaders rushed to clarify that she would not be retiring from active politics but the speculation was put to rest only after her daughter Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra said that Sonia will contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Amethi.

However, the exit poll predictions are not agreeable to us. The final result will be out on Monday and everyone has to accept it,\" he said. The Sena leader was speaking to reporters at his residence Matoshree in suburban Bandra. \"There is a big difference between the atmosphere prevalent in Gujarat and the predictions of exit polls,\" he added.

Taking a dig at the BJP, he said the country expected a lot from the NDA lead party, but it has not been able to tackle issues like farm loan waiver and unemployment. \"The Sena did not change its colours after coming to power. Our stand remains clear (on issues of public importance). Nobody should teach us what we should do,\" he said. Asked if the post of Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra was offered to the Sena by the BJP, he replied in the negative.

He also launched CNG-run scooters and auto-rickshaws. Pradhan said the environment-friendly fuel will help in reducing air pollution. \"While many cities of the country are suffering due to transportation pollution, CNG will be a smart fuel for the capital city,\" he said while inaugurating the CNG stations. He said CNG connection is the New Year gift for Odisha. \"We had announced to provide cooking gas to households in Bhubaneswar through pipeline. We kept our promises and started it in the city. Now we introduced CNG in the state. It will bring positive change in the lives of people,\" he said. He said a CNG-run scooter can run 80 km per one kg of this fuel. An auto-rickshaw can show a mileage of 60 km per 1 kg of CNG. A person can save 30 to 40 per cent of his/her oil expenses every month, he added. Pradhan said two more stations will be ready soon at Khandagiri and Tamando area. \"We are planning to build 15 similar stations in Bhubaneswar and 10 others at Cuttack in a phased manner to promote the use of CNG,\" he added. The rate of 1 kg of CNG is Rs 59. Pradhan launched the CNG service by filling gas in the auto-rickshaw of one Dillip Kumar Ram of Bomikhal area. \"I was driving auto rickshaw in Delhi by using CNG. I know about the fuel. It will save my money and fuel every month,\" he added. A total of 50 CNG-run auto-rickshaws and 17 scooters will ply in the city from Saturday. To avail the service, an owner has to convert his/her scooter into CNG mode by spending Rs 15,500. They can get interest-free loan from Bank of Maharashtra, said a GAIL official. The service is an initiative under City Gas Distribution (CGD) project implemented by the GAIL (India) Limited, a government-owned natural gas transmission company. Initially, the company will bring natural gas to Bhubaneswar in special containers called as cascades by road from Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh. Later, it will be supplied through the 2,655 km long Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra Natural Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL), which is known as Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga project. The minister will also lay foundation stone on Sunday for two gas pipelines - one new Dhamra-Angul main line and Bhubaneswar-Cuttack-Paradip spur line - to supply gas to the CGD project and other commercial purposes. For the 769-km-long gas pipeline project in Odisha, the company will spend Rs 4,000 crore. It will cover 13 districts and major industrial clusters of the state. \"We have set a target to complete the project by December 2019,\" said an officer from GAIL (India) Limited. Besides, the gas transporter will sign term-sheets with industrial customers for supply of natural gas and an MoU for skill development of local youths to ensure their employability in various important jobs related to the gas pipeline project.','INDIA','Hemanta Pradhan','2017-12-16 22:58:00','| TNN | Dec 16, 2017, 22:58 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:23'),(140,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-armed-forces-mark-vijay-diwas-in-jammu-kashmir/articleshow/62099042.cms','Indian armed forces mark Vijay Diwas in Jammu & Kashmir','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62099282,width-400,resizemode-4/62099282.jpg]','JAMMU: The Indian armed forces today celebrated Vijay Diwas, which marks Indias victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war, with traditional enthusiasm in Jammu and Kashmir.

Goyals remarks came days after the Railway Board formed a six-member committee to review the flexi-fare scheme. Speaking after a day-long conclave of senior officials in the capital, he said that the national transporter is studying a model of dynamic pricing which is offered by the airlines and hotels. \"We have been deliberating on a dynamic pricing policy. We had been discussing that the price should not go up but I want to take it a step further. I am exploring a possibility where, if trains are not fully-booked, we can offer discounted fares.\" He also questioned why flexi-fares should only mean an increase in the price of rail tickets. \"Just like the airlines and hotels where a person gets discount at the last minute, it (the railways) should also offer discounts on the routes with relatively low occupancy,\" he said. The six-member committee, set up on December 11, has been mandated to recommend ways to offer a more lucrative scheme which may include loyalty and other benefits to the passengers. The board has also asked the panel to consider modifications or amendments to the the flexi-fare system to offer passengers flexibility of rates during peak season, lean season or during week days, weekends or festivals. The committee has been asked to submit its report within 30 days. The flexi-fare system, launched in September 2016, led to up to 50 per cent increase in fares. Under the formula, base fares increase from 10 per cent to 50 per cent with every 10 per cent of berths booked. While revenue increased, the railways lost passengers as several berths remained vacant, officials said. Goyal also said that in the coming year, plans are being made to maximise utilisation of assets. \"In the airlines, we see the maintenance of an aircraft is completed within 30 minutes and it is prepared for another journey. In the same way, the railway rakes should be utilised to full capacity.\" \"It is a saying that one should be able to sweat ones assets. Right now a Rajdhani Express train from Delhi to Mumbai stays at the station for maintenance. It can be maintained and cleaned by 22 teams in 30 minutes and again be prepared to go on a journey of two or three hours, beside its original return journey,\" he said. \"It can be utilised for a small trip in that time. Going ahead I would want that the trip between Delhi and Mumbai be completed within 11 hours while half-an-hour on each side goes in maintenance. So a round trip would become possible,\" the minister said. He was replying to a question on whether the railways was exploring the possibility of a Rajdhani Express train making a round trip within 24 hours to maximise utilisation. Goyal said that while the national transporter was already trying out an experiment on the Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani by using two engines, he has also suggested that the train should depart from Delhi at 5pm instead of 4pm, allowing people one more hour to do work. \"It should reach Mumbai by 7am instead of 6am in the morning, allowing people to sleep for an additional hour,\" he added.','INDIA','','2017-12-16 19:55:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 19:55 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:24'),(142,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congresss-working-style-corrupt-ways-remain-same-bjp-on-rahuls-elevation/articleshow/62096324.cms','Congresss working style, corrupt ways remain same: BJP shrugs off Rahuls elevation','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62096419,width-400,resizemode-4/62096419.jpg]','NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday dubbed the Congress as a \"corrupt thought process\" as it shrugged off Rahul Gandhis elevation as its president, saying its working style and \"corrupt ways\" remained the same. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra launched a sharp attack on the Congress after Gandhi attacked the ruling party soon after replacing her mother Sonia Gandhi as its president. Patra cited the sentencing of former Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda, who was supported by the Congress, in a corruption case to hit out at the party, claiming it would remain corrupt despite the change in leadership. He said it was an irony that despite the Congress not being in power for four years, corruption cases were still tumbling out. \"This speaks volumes about the thought process, the working nature of Congress party. So a new president or an old president, the working style of Congress party, the corrupt ways of Congress party still remain the same,\" he told reporters. Watch: Rahul continues Nehru-Gandhi legacy He said when the Congress talks about a change in leadership, the country is seeing how during its 10-year rule, corruption of ten to fourteen lakh crore rupees took place under their very nose. \"Congress is not an ancient thought process as claimed by a few, rather Congress is a corrupt thought process and that has been proved by the judicial process today,\" Patra added. After assuming the leadership of the party, Rahul Gandhi accused the BJP of spreading hatred and alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was taking India back to medieval times+ . \"The BJP is spreading hatred and communalism ... they break, while we unite. They ignite fire, we douse it,\" Gandhi said. Asked about the Aag laga ke (ignite fire) comment, Patra said this is \"not a decent way\" to react. \"Elections are won not because of riots on streets, not because sadak pe aag laga ke. Elections are won because the mantra of reform, transform and perform works in the country under the able leadership of Narendra Modi,\" he said. He went on to add that elections are won as people compare how during the UPA days, the direct benefit transfer (DBT) was not there and the money could not reach the pockets of poor man. \"Today because of DBT, what the poor man deserves, reaches his pocket. Elections are won by giving LPG cylinders to the last man standing in the queue, when electricity reaches every village. \"So my simple request is we should not demean the basic nature of democracy in the country. Democracy is vibrant in the country because development is taking place as never before,\" he added. Patra said that today is an important day as Madhu Koda, who was the chief minister of Jharkhand with the support of Congress party, has been sentenced to three years in jail because of his involvement in the coal scam. \"We all know that Madhu Koda was an Independent MLA, but because of the fact that the government was formed with the outside support of the Congress party, the government then was almost a Congress government run by 10 Janpath, 24 Akbar Road by the help of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Ahmed Patel,\" he said.','INDIA','','2017-12-16 16:58:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 16:58 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:25'),(143,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/some-indian-farmers-are-turning-moon-gazers/articleshow/62099577.cms','Some Indian farmers are turning moon-gazers','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62099589,width-400,resizemode-4/62099589.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/62099600/Master.jpg]','A growing number of cultivators opt for biodynamic techniques to give farming a zodiac twist Sarvdaman Patel, 69, stands between rows of legumes and parsley at high noon, but it is not the harsh sun that bothers him. He is obsessed with the moon. \"It is currently in the Air sign which is ideal for flowering plants,\" he remarks, peering at the marigolds. Patel is no Bejan Daruwala. He is an Indian farmer who has been using biodynamic (BD) techniques for the last 16 years on his farm in Gujarats Anand. The BD cultivation calendar is based on the moons movement through each zodiac every two-and-a-half days covering all 12 signs every month. An unofficial estimate by the Biodynamic Association of India (BDAI) says about one lakh farmers in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand practise biodynamic farming. However, most of the produce is sold under the generic organic label as few consumers understand the difference. Besides following astrological signs for cultivation, BD also relies on natural composts. Research and manufacturing institute, bioRe, India has been conducting long-term comparison trials of four farming systems — organic, biodynamic, conventional and GMO (genetically modified crops) — under same soil and weather conditions since 2007. First-phase results have been encouraging, says Vivek Rawal, bioRe CEO. Research has found that BD farming provides better quality of foodgrains and more stable yields compared to other systems. Soil quality also improves. \"We have observed 0.5% growth in organic carbon content and an increase in soil micro-organisms, Rawal says. Vivek Cariappa from Krac-a-Dawna farms in Kodaikanal attests to this. A biodynamic farmer for the last 15 years, his yield has remained stable while others using conventional methods have seen declines. Cariappa, who grows seasonal vegetables, pulses, cotton and indigo, says that conventional agriculture has taken away too much from nature. \"Consumers should make the effort to find the source of what they eat, or use,\" he says. Eco-farms: A BD farm in Noida being prepared for sowing Corporate trainer and dance instructor Aamir Ahmed is a new convert. It bothered him that the people he met in the course of his work were affluent but unhealthy. Ahmed and his partner have put aside 1.5 acres of their Noida farm, Rewild, to develop biodynamic methods of agriculture. The plan is to rent it out to city-dwellers who would want to grow their own vegetables free of chemicals. Besides following the moon cycle, a BD farmer is advised to use natural composts such as BD 500, which is cow manure packed inside a female cow horn and buried in the ground 40-60cm deep in autumn. In spring the fermented compost is dug up, diluted with water and sprayed just before dawn on the farm. BD 501 is powdered quartz packed inside a female cow horn and buried for six months through spring and summer. This is supposed to harness the cosmic forces of nature. Many farmers have their own hacks. Like planting a row of onions next to cauliflower puts off pests from attacking the crop while growing hemp improves nitrogen in the soil. Among the biggest success stories of BD farming has been Araku coffee grown in the Araku Valley of Andhra. Run by the AP Girijan Cooperative Corporation and supported by the Naandi Foundation, Araku is now the largest coffee plantation in the world to be certified organic and biodynamic. The arabica coffee plantation that supports 100,000 adivasis sells online and even debuted in France in February this year. Farmers grow arabica coffee organically using bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides and encouraging natural predators such as spiders to get rid of pests. BD farming has its pitfalls too. It is a very specialised form of agriculture that requires material and skills that small and marginal farmers may find difficult to acquire and adapt to. Also, certification is an expensive and cumbersome process. Some have even dismissed it as pseudoscience. But farmers like Patel and Cariappa continue to teach others around them and spread the word.','INDIA','Himanshi Dhawan','2017-12-17 00:00:00','| TNN | Dec 17, 2017, 00:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:25'),(144,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delighted-congress-workers-celebrate-rahuls-elevation/articleshow/62099507.cms','Delighted Congress workers celebrate Rahuls elevation','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62099505,width-400,resizemode-4/62099505.jpg]','NEW DELHI: Akbar Road in the leafy central Delhi was the scene of a celebration the Congress party would want to replicate across India under its new president, Rahul Gandhi.

Women played with gulal and young party workers danced to the beats of dhols. Congressmen and women were so determined in celebrating the elevation of Rahul Gandhi that the outgoing Congress chief, Sonia Gandhi, had to pause her farewell speech thrice. Some of the workers felt that the glory and buzz witnessed at the Akbar Road office of the party, which once ruled the length and breadth of India, was seen after a long time. Soon after Rahul Gandhi was handed over a formal certificate by partys election authority, Sonia Gandhi rose to speak. She, however, had to repeatedly stop in the middle of her speech, distracted by the bursting of crackers outside. \"I cant speak... my voice...

He said it is for the USA to decide their stand on net neutrality but \"Our stand from day one is very clear - right of non-discriminatory access to internet is not negotiable\". The sector regulator, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, had issued a regulation in February 2016 on discriminatory pricing over internet access which led to ban of platforms like Free Basics and Airtel Zero. TRAI ruled against discriminatory pricing for different data platforms or content and said operators cannot enter into pacts with internet companies to subsidise access to some websites. As per ruling, the companies violating the rules will be fined Rs 50,000 per day for the duration of contravention, subject to a maximum of Rs 50 lakh. Facebook was offering free internet access to some websites that were available on its Free Basics platform. Following debate over net neutrality, Prasad as the telecom minister had set up a panel of officers from the Department of Telecom (DoT) to examine the matter and come up with recommendations. Prasad had then said the government would take a holistic view on net neutrality after the DoT panel and TRAI finalise their recommendations. The DoT panel too had recommended bar on platforms like Free Basics as it will act as gatekeeper to the internet. Last month, TRAI finalised its recommendations on net neutrality in which it prohibited internet service providers from making any discrimination in traffic while providing web access by either blocking or throttling some apps, websites and services or by offering fast lanes to others. \"I believe internet is one of the finest creation of mankind and must be available for all. If internet is a global platform it must have link with local,\" Prasad said. The DoT has to now take call on TRAI recommendations over net neutrality. He said the government is making efforts to make India a $1 trillion digital economy in coming 5 years which include IT, IT enabled services, shared economy etc. The IT minister further said the government recently provided \"duty shield\" to electronic and mobile sectors to promote domestic manufacturing. Prasad said there were two companies that were making mobile phones in the country when he took over as IT and communications minister. \"I am happy to announce today, India today is home to 108 mobile factories in the last three years,\" he said.

And there is no provision in the Navy or in the rules and regulation where you can go and do what he has gone and done. Thats why he has been dismissed from the service for violating the rules and regulations. \"We told the court that we cannot do that (take her into employment). And we have told the court that if a private party is willing to employ her, come as a contract worker in the Navy (as an employee of the private party, not as Navys direct employee),\" he explained. \"We are a gender-neutral service. We make no distinctions based on gender. We induct both men and women. They both have rigorous training and same rules and regulations are followed,\" he added. The Navy chief said the defence wing is committed to the governments Make in India programme and currently as many as 34 ships and submarines are under construction in Indian shipyards. Meanwhile, Air Force Academy said, in a statement, that 105 flight cadets passed out today as Flying Officers, including 15 women officers. The officers include two fighter pilots, it said.','INDIA','','2017-12-16 22:01:00','PTI | Dec 16, 2017, 22:01 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:27'),(147,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-totally-geared-up-to-face-any-situation-in-doklam-goc-in-c/articleshow/62097689.cms','Army totally geared up to face any situation in Doklam: GOC-in-C','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62097728,width-400,resizemode-4/62097728.jpg]','KOLKATA: The Army is totally geared up to face any situation in the Doklam sector and any mischief will be dealt with \"properly\", General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Command Lt Gen Abhay Krishna said on Saturday. He was asked about China reportedly stationing its troops in Doklam, where the two countries were locked in a standoff for over two months earlier this year after the Chinese army tried to build a road in the area claimed by Indian-ally Bhutan. India feared the road, if completed, would allow China to cut off its access to its northeastern states.

The road building effort by China and presence of its troops at the tri-junction between India, China and Bhutan had led to an eyeball-to-eyeball face off between New Delhi and Beijing for 73 days from June 16.

Her exit was as subdued as her entry was spirited. \"I am going to retire,\" the 71-year-old Member of Parliament told reporters yesterday, sending party leaders into a tizzy and hastening to explain that she was not quitting politics. But Indira Gandhis daughter-in-law is known to spring surprises. If her successor was often described as the reluctant heir of the family, she was even more loath to take up a political role. Legend has it that when Congress leaders pressed Rajiv Gandhi to occupy the prime ministers chair after the assassination of his mother Indira Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi begged him not to, fearful about her familys safety. Seven years later, when he was killed, she turned away when party leaders urged her to lead the Congress. It was another seven years later, when the party was in tatters at the Centre and in power only in four states, that she agreed to pick up the reins of the party. She was persuaded to do so after senior leaders left the Congress and set up their own regional outfits. When the Congress was in a shambles, Sonia Gandhi — described by sections of the media as the most powerful woman in India — steered it to victory in 2004, ousting the NDA. That wasnt all. When it appeared that she would occupy the highest office in South Block, she told the surprised media that she had chosen Manmohan Singh as the prime minister of the United Progressive Alliance government. Today, party leaders look back at her presidency with pride, hailing unity and strength as the hallmarks of her record breaking 19-year tenure. Watch: Rahul continues Nehru-Gandhi legacy Sonia Gandhi took a back seat after several rounds of illness recently, for which she had be hospitalised. She exits active Congress politics on a high note and as one of the tallest leaders of the party in recent years. Sonia Gandhis sharpest weapon was her silence. She spoke little, and seldom in public, but wielded enormous power in the Congress. In cotton saris that reminded old-timers of her mother- in-law, she has over the years addressed public rallies in her accented Hindi, suitably blunting the opposition BJPs campaign against her Italian roots. Under her stewardship, the Congress led the Centre for two terms from 2004 to 2014 and returned to power in a host of states. The then party president achieved this by successfully stitching electoral alliance with like-minded parties. UPA-1 and UPA II were fine examples of Sonia Gandhis ability to bring non-BJP forces together. Her prediction of the Congress returning at the Centre on its own, made at the partys Pachmarhi conference, never came true though. That said, Gandhi braved tremendous odds to earn her place in Indian politics, as she conquered the limitations of language and her foreign origin to win the hearts of people. Born to Italian parents in Lusiana, Vicenza (Italy), on December 9, 1946, Gandhi met Rajiv Gandhi in England where she was studying. The young language student and the son of then Indian prime minister were married 1968. Contemporary history recalls how she cradled her mother- in-laws body after she was gunned down by her bodyguards, and later tried to persuade her husband not to take up the prime ministers post. After Rajiv Gandhis assassination in May, 1991, she shunned active politics, but after repeated cajoling by Congress leaders took the primary membership of Congress in 1997. Amid consequent widespread demands from rank and file to lead a shaky party, she entered public life in 1998, a move that was widely and loudly welcomed in the party. She was first elected as an MP from Amethi in 1999, following which she became the Leader of the Opposition in the Lower House. She later shifted to Rae Bareli to accommodate her son in Amethi. In 2004, she led the electoral campaign of her party which secured the largest number of seats and formed a coalition government. When she nominated Singh as the prime minister, her standing went up by several notches. Her supporters called it an act of sacrifice while some saw it as a political masterstroke. Gandhi, however, continued to wield power in the party as the chairperson of the UPA and the leader of the Congress party in Parliament, leading its strategy inside and outside the Houses. She also introduced the concept of National Advisory Council (NAC), a forum that made periodic recommendations to the government and often dubbed as a \"dual power centre\" by the opposition. As its chairperson, Gandhi took up issues related to environment, gender, empowerment of the disadvantaged and right to information. At a personal level, Sonia Gandhi has authored two books on her husband, Rajiv and Rajivs World, and has edited two volumes of letters exchanged between Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. Her other interests include reading, Indian art — contemporary, classical as well as tribal — handlooms and handicrafts and music. She has a diploma in conservation of oil paintings from the National Museum in New Delhi. While she may find time to pursue her passions now, her son is set for tough times with the Congress at a historic electoral low in its entire history. In power only in five states now, and facing difficult elections in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, the Congress, everyone agrees, is facing its worst existential crisis ever. Congress leaders feel that she will continue to play the role of a mentor to the party for times to come. She may also continue as the chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary party and the UPA alliance. As a Congress leader says, \"Even now, Rahul Gandhi is bound to consult his mother on every important party related decision he takes.\"','INDIA','','2017-12-16 17:58:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 17:58 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:28'),(149,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-narendra-modi-announces-rs-90000-crore-for-improving-roads-highways-in-ne/articleshow/62096557.cms','PM Narendra Modi announces Rs 90000 crore for improving roads, highways in NE','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62096622,width-400,resizemode-4/62096622.jpg]','GUWAHATI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday committed an investment of Rs 90,000 cr in the next two to three years to build a network of highways and roads in the northeastern region.

The Chief Minister has directed the Power Secretary and Chairman of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to examine the implications of the two-part tariff and issue an advisory to the concerned department to freeze industrial power tariff at Rs. 5 per unit, as already approved by the state cabinet. The Chief Minister reiterated his commitment to provide tariff for the industry at Rs 5 per unit for five years under the \"Industrial and Business Development Policy 2017\" notified on October 17, and said his government will work to ensure that it meets its promise in this regard. With this assurance, the Chief Minister has laid to rest all apprehensions of the government reneging on its promise of freezing of industrial power tariff at Rs 5 per unit for the next five years. While it was the prerogative of the Commission to fix power tariff in all categories under the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, the government will ensure that it meets its commitment to power users in the state, the Chief Minister said in the wake of the notification of the PSERC Tariff Order for the year 2017-18. He promised that his government would provide the necessary subsidy to PSPCL accordingly, to meet its commitments for providing free/affordable power to various categories of consumers including agriculture, industry, scheduled castes, backward classes and below poverty-line domestic consumers. The government will ensure that power is provided to small consumers at part with the existing tariff of Rs.4.99 per KWH - a move that will benefit 85,000 small industrial consumers, while keeping the overall tariff to Rs. 5.00 per unit in the new scenario of a two-part tariff, for industrial consumers in the medium and large category, said Captain Amarinder. Reiterating his governments commitment to provide quality power on 24 x 7 basis to all the domestic, commercial and industrial consumers in the state, the Chief Minister further said free power to agriculture consumers would continue, as would up to 200 units per month to Scheduled Caste (SC), Backward Class (BC) & Non-SC BPL domestic consumers, and up to 300 units per month to Freedom Fighter Domestic Consumers. On the hike announced by PSERC in domestic tariff, the Chief Minister said the nominal increase was necessitated by the increasing cost of power generation and distribution and pointed out that the domestic power tariff had been static for the past three years. He further noted that despite the hike, the domestic power rate in Punjab continues to be lower than all neighbouring states, except Himachal Pradesh.','CITY-LUDHIANA','Mohit Behl','2017-10-23 22:18:00','| TNN | Oct 23, 2017, 22:18 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:29'),(151,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/North-Korea-fires-5-short-range-projectiles-into-sea/articleshow/51493246.cms','North Korea fires 5 short-range projectiles into sea','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-51493243,width-400,resizemode-4/51493243.jpg]','SEOUL: North Korea fired five short-range projectiles into the sea on Monday, Seoul officials said, in a continuation of weapon launches it has carried out in an apparent response to ongoing South Korea-US military drills it sees as a provocation. The projectiles launched from a site near the northeastern city of Hamhung flew about 200 kilometers (125 miles) before landing in waters off North Koreas east coast, South Koreas joint chiefs of staff said. The firings came three days after Seoul said North Korea launched its first medium-range missile into the sea since early 2014, ignoring UN resolutions against such tests. South Koreas Yonhap news agency initially reported that a missile had also been launched on Monday, but later changed that to say projectiles had been fired. In recent weeks, North Korea has stepped up its bellicose rhetoric, threatening pre-emptive nuclear strikes against Washington and Seoul and firing short-range missiles and artillery into the sea. The firings appear to be North Koreas response to annual springtime US-South Korean military exercises that it says are a rehearsal for an invasion. Earlier this month, North Korea fired several short-range missiles and artillery shells into the sea and threatened pre-emptive nuclear strikes against Washington and Seoul. This years drills are the largest ever, and come after North Korea conducted a nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch earlier this year, leading the UN Security Council to impose its toughest sanctions on the country in two decades. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recently ordered tests of a nuclear warhead and ballistic missiles capable of carrying such warheads. He issued the orders while overseeing what state media called a successful simulated test of a re-entry vehicle aimed at returning a nuclear warhead to the atmosphere from space so it could hit its intended target. The re-entry vehicle is considered one of the last major technologies North Korea must master to develop long-range missiles equipped with nuclear weapons capable of reaching the US mainland. Analysts in South Korea said the medium-range missile launch last Friday may have been a test of the re-entry technology. North Korean state media have not commented on the reported launch. South Korean defense officials say North Korea doesnt yet have functioning intercontinental ballistic missiles.','WORLD-REST-OF-WORLD','','2016-03-21 14:25:00','Agencies | Updated: Mar 21, 2016, 14:25 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:31'),(152,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/on-the-rise-5-die-of-lepto-dengue-in-2-weeks-of-september/articleshow/60715961.cms','On the rise: 5 die of lepto, dengue in 2 weeks of September','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-60715960,width-400,resizemode-4/60715960.jpg]','MUMBAI: At least five people, including two children, have died of dengue and leptospirosis in the first two weeks of this month.

Thanks to the Trump administrations review of the visa policy, some of the best minds in the country who had bagged crore-plus offers are now settling for lesser placements. While firms are trying their best to get IIT graduates on board as promised, many on campus are wary of US offers in the upcoming placement season. The number of US offers had, in any case, dropped to single digits at leading IITs last December after the change in the countrys regime. Placement cells at IITs are now looking beyond the US for international profiles. Japan, Taiwan, Canada, Singapore and some European countries have begun to rise in students preference list. Very few IIT graduates who were offered jobs last year have started work in the US. The remaining have joined the organizations India offices or are being offered alternatives abroad. Microsoft, for instance, has offered Canadian positions to students. \"The students are looking forward to joining the Canadian office soon. Though the packages are not the same, most organizations have a good reputation. And they promise to move students to US locations after they complete a year or two, when they manage the visas,\" said an IIT-Bombay graduate. Some three to four students of IIT-Bombay have been affected. A computer science and engineering student from the Powai campus said, \"Students are always keen on US jobs, but many prefer to work for a year or two and then pursue higher studies. If it takes more than a year just to get US visas, the job location is of little consequence. Such students would rather choose better domestic opportunities. Getting student visas is easier than getting H1B visas now.\" Older IITs, though open to inviting US firms, are also treading cautiously to ensure students do not get a raw deal. At one of the older IITs, a student who had bagged a US job quit to join another company after his visa application was rejected. \"He was asked to work in the Bangalore office. He was one of our batch toppers,\" said a student from that institute. \"Everyone, including the companies, are a little cautious about the visa policy in the US. Apart from the US, we are also increasingly looking at European firms from Germany and Amsterdam who have agreed to visit the campus. It is our policy to reach out to everyone,\" said a student coordinator from IIT-Kanpur. The placement cell at IIT-Bombay, too, intends to seek some kind of assurance from US firms visiting the institute this December, said a coordinator. \"Many of these software giants remain students top preferences. IIT-Bombay is also reaching out to most of the Asian and European firms, apart from the US. Japan, Taiwan, Singapore have been showing keen interest in IITs,\" said a student coordinator from IIT-B. A member of the All India Placement Committee of the IITs said that students from the older, established IITs are hit by this crisis compared with newer ones. \"The offers at other IITs were almost negligible last year.

Chavan confirmed to TOI that since not a single member was enrolled in the district, it was not possible to hold the organisational elections; as a result, the party had no option but to sack the district president and dissolve all committees. \"We have initiated the process for organisational elections. It was found that in the recent past, not a single member was enrolled in the entire district. Under such circumstances, it was decided to dissolve all the committees, Chavan said.

In Congress circles, it is believed that Rane, along with his sons Nilesh and Nitesh, will soon join the BJP , maybe after the Navratri festival. In the recent past, CM Devendra Fadnavis and state BJP president Raosaheb Danve had visited Ranes residence. If a BJP cabinet member is to be believed, BJP has offered Rane nomination to the Rajya Sabha, induction of Nitesh as a minister of state and nomination of Nilesh to the state legislative council, while Rane has submitted that he should be inducted into the state cabinet, Nilesh to Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha and Nitesh to the state assembly . \"Since we have set the target of 350-plus seats for Lok Sabha and 200 for assembly , we feel Rane, who has considerable clout in Konkan region, will help us improve our strength,\" said the BJP cabinet member.

This number was confirmed by senior co-operative officials. In many instances, transfer fees, which are charged by the CHS and paid by incoming and outgoing members when a flat in the CHS is sold, contribute significantly towards a societys annual collection. While the model bylaws under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act have placed a limit of Rs 25,000 on transfer fees, in reality the fees run into a lakh or more per transfer. Thus, collections from transfer fees may mean that even CHSs housing the middle classes may find themselves having a turnover of over the threshold of Rs 20 lakh and would need to register under GST. \"In such instances, any transfer fee paid to the society by the new owner on exchange of ownership of flat will be taxable under GST at 18%,\" said Ramesh Prabhu, chairman of Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association which has a membership of over 50,000 societies. For instance, the Siddhivinayak housing society in Chembur has found itself in a situation where it has had to register under GST, said Roshan Matkari, a society member. Once a society is registered under GST, it has to meet various filing obligations. It also has to comply with the provisions of the reverse charge mechanism. Under this mechanism, if it makes payments to unregistered service providers such as cleaners, electricians and plumbers, it will have to bear the GST of 18% on such payments and also have to file relevant forms on the GSTN portal. But what is important for flat owners is that the criteria for registration and for imposition of GST on maintenance charges collected from members are different. The government has time and again clarified that GST will be levied on maintenance charges collected from flat owners (members of the CHS) only if the annual collection of the society is Rs20 lakh or more and the monthly maintenance charge is more than Rs5,000 per member (See graphic). Maintenance charges are typically collected by a CHS for various purposes like providing security, lift maintenance, maintenance of common areas like a lobby or a garden and are typically a reimbursement for expenses incurred. As explained by TOI earlier, taxes like property, water, or electricity charges collected by the CHS from its members on behalf of local authorities or power entities will not be subject to GST. According to a government circular, co-operative housing societies under GST are entitled to input tax credit (ITC) in respect of taxes paid by them on capital goods (such as generators, water pumps, lawn furniture), goods (such as taps, pipes, other sanitary/hardware fillings) and against input services such as repair and maintenance services. Despite availability of input tax credit, several members find an increase in their bills, owing to the rate increase from 15% to 18%. Vidyesh Karmarkar from Jeevandayini cooperative housing society in Malad said his society had already started charging 3% more taxation than before, thus taking the overall taxation on Rs5,300 monthly maintenance to Rs954. \"Earlier we paid Rs795 on the same amount. Thus the new taxation is a net increase of Rs159 on the bill,\" he pointed out. Flat owners who have been asked to pay GST by their CHS should check that the society has obtained valid registration. \"How can I pay GST on the bill which does not bear an authentic GST registration number?\" asked Ashlesha Mujumdar, who resides in a flat in a CHS.','CITY-MUMBAI','Chittaranjan Tembhekar','2017-09-17 02:27:00','| TNN | Sep 17, 2017, 02:27 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:35'),(158,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/mumbai/teens-sore-eyes-refuse-to-heal-docs-find-its-drug-resistant-tb/articleshow/60812242.cms','Teens sore eyes refuse to heal, docs find its drug-resistant TB','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-60812284,width-400,resizemode-4/60812284.jpg]','MUMBAI: When Nerul teenager Ranis (name changed) `sore eyes didnt heal for over 15 days, little did her parents imagine that multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) could be the cause.

Mumbai is referred to as the epicentre of the deadly drug-re sistant TB in which patients show resistance to two or more known anti-TB drugs; treatment involves newer antibiotics that are expensive. \"We couldnt afford the two-year-long treatment that runs into Rs 2 lakh or more, so Dr Mathew referred us to a government centre for free medicines,\" said Ranis mother.\"She has to take daily injections for six months as a part of the treatment, but they are painful,\" she added. An eye specialist with a government hospital said the eye symptom could be an \"immunological response to TB\". Dr Suresh added that the \"dramatic presentation\" could be because MDR TB is more virulent. Chest specialist Dr Yatin Dholakia, however, said that eye involvement in TB isnt uncommon. \"Even eye TB is common these days.

A computer science and engineering student from the Powai campus said, \"Students are always keen on US jobs, but many prefer to work for a year or two and then pursue higher studies.

It urged Russia \"to address these concerns in a substantial and transparent way, and actively engage in a technical dialogue with the United States.

The Saudi General Directorate of Traffic gave details of the new regulations that will follow the lifting of the ban on the official Saudi Press Agency late on Friday. \"Yes, we will authorise women to drive motorcycles\" as well as trucks, it said, adding that the royal decree stipulates that the law on driving will be \"equal\" for both men and women.

Police acting on a tip-off raided a home near the coastal town of Teknaf in southeastern Bangladesh, where five people had assembled ahead of a promised voyage across the Bay of Bengal. Two Rohingya Muslims, both men, were among the group. The pair had arrived from Myanmar since August, when a surge of violence in Rakhine state forced hundreds of thousands of Rohingya across the border. The other three would-be passengers were Bangladeshi, another police officer said. \"They were herded there as part of an effort to take them to Malaysia. They said they would be taken there by sea,\" Teknaf police chief Main Uddin told AFP. \"Among the five, there were two Rohingya men who had already paid 10,000 taka ($120) each. The arrested person is being charged with human trafficking.\" The would-be passengers told police they had promised to pay the alleged trafficker, a Bangladeshi, another 200,000 taka each upon arrival in Malaysia. Since August nearly 650,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled a military operation in Myanmars westernmost Rakhine state described by the UN and US as \"ethnic cleansing\". Bangladesh authorities worry many refugees may risk travelling to Southeast Asia by boat, a route once popular among Rohingya seeking economic opportunities outside the grim, long-standing camps in Coxs Bazar. People smugglers in recent years have sent tens of thousands of Rohingya from Bangladesh to Malaysia, a Muslim- majority country in Southeast Asia, usually between November and March when seas are calmest. But these networks were targeted by Bangladesh in 2015 after Thai authorities discovered mass graves and boats overcrowded with thousands of migrants drifted at sea while Southeast Asian nations squabbled over a solution. Bangladesh police said they were questioning the alleged people smuggler to determine whether he was part of a larger regional trafficking ring. Bangladesh has arrested dozens of suspected traffickers and broken up networks since the 2015 crackdown, but authorities fear these networks could be revived during the latest Rohingya crisis. The refugees living in camps in Coxs Bazar are prohibited from leaving the area, but already aid groups and officials say trafficking networks are targeting the stateless minority. Bangladesh in recent months has stepped up patrols in coastal areas and fishing villages where traffickers moor their vessels, police say. \"We have zero tolerance toward human trafficking. We are working day and night,\" Iqbal Hossain, head of police in Coxs Bazar district where the Rohingya camps are located, told AFP.

The historic reforms were given royal assent on December 8, the final step in a process that began with a national postal vote in September. There was supposed to be a 30-day waiting period after couples registered to marry, with the first weddings expected on January 9. But some sought an exemption due to their circumstances, and the first ceremonies went ahead on Saturday, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne. \"Australias first legal same-sex marriage has just taken place. Congratulations Amy and Lauren,\" Equal Marriage Rights Australia announced on its Facebook page. Fairfax Media said Lauren Price, 31, and Amy Laker, 29, solemnised their vows in Sydney, while Melbourne couple Amy and Elise McDonald -- who coincidentally have the same surname -- tied the knot two hours later. A photo showed Price and Laker dressed in traditional white gowns and holding hands as they said \"I do\" on a glorious Sydney day. Among hundreds of comments on the Facebook page, Paul Antoine said: \"Now... has the country collapsed? NOOO!! Two women have just shown their love. Pretty simple, but nonetheless special in my view!\" Jason Chapman added: \"Relentless dedication from so many over the last fifty years have led us to enjoy this beautiful moment of equality. Congratulations ladies.\" All but four members of Australias 150-seat lower House of Representatives voted in support of marriage equality, with the legislation passing without any religious freedom amendments that some were pushing for. The bill was introduced in parliament by the conservative government after Australians in November endorsed the reforms in a contentious voluntary postal vote. Nearly 80 percent of eligible voters took part in the poll, and almost 62 percent of those who voted chose \"yes\" on their ballots. Fairfax said Price and Laker had originally intended to hold a commitment ceremony at the British consulate because Price was from Wales. But when the new law was passed, they sought an exemption from the normal waiting period because Prices family had already travelled to Sydney for the celebrations. Melbournes Amy and Elise McDonald, aged 36 and 28, reportedly only got permission to marry on Saturday morning, gaining an exemption for similar reasons, according to the Herald Sun newspaper. They were allowed to have a legal marriage on financial grounds and because their families had travelled from overseas. Same-sex marriage is now recognised in more than 20 countries, of which 16 are in Europe.','WORLD-REST-OF-WORLD','','2017-12-16 22:19:00','AFP | Dec 16, 2017, 22:19 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:41'),(169,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-issues-new-rules-on-us-visa-waivers/articleshow/62091850.cms','Trump administration issues new rules on US visa waivers','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62091851,width-400,resizemode-4/62091851.jpg]','WASHINGTON: The Trump administration put new requirements in place on Friday for the 38 countries participating in the US Visa Waiver Program, including that they use US counterterrorism data to screen travelers, officials said. The program allows citizens of mainly European countries to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. Citizens from the 38 countries are required to obtain a so-called travel authorization to enter the United States. President Donald Trump has sought to tighten the rules for those seeking to visit or live in the United States in several ways, saying restrictions are necessary for security reasons. The changes will apply to all countries in the program. One change is that they will be required to use US information to screen travelers crossing their borders from third countries. Many countries in the program already do that, one administration official said. Countries whose citizens stay longer than authorized during visits to the United States at a relatively higher rate will be required to conduct public awareness campaigns on the consequences of overstays, the officials said. One existing penalty is that people who overstay a visit may not travel visa-free to the United States in the future. The threshold for the overstay rate triggering the public information campaign requirement is two percent, the officials said. In the 2016 fiscal year, of the VWP countries, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, and San Marino, a wealthy enclave landlocked inside central Italy, had total overstay rates higher than two percent, according to a report by the Department of Homeland Security. The overall overstay rate for VWP countries is 0.68 percent, lower than non-VWP countries excluding Canada and Mexico, which is at 2.07 percent, according to the DHS report. Members of Congress have expressed concern about the security risks of overstays. A May 2017 report by the DHS inspector general found the department lacked a comprehensive system to gather information on departing visitors, forcing it to rely on third-party data to confirm departures, which is sometimes faulty. The United States will also start assessing VWP countries on their safeguards against \"insider threats\" at their airports, especially those with direct flights to the United States, officials said. The goal is to ensure countries \"make sure that airport employees, aviation workers et cetera, arent corrupted or are co-opted to pose a threat to aircraft, especially those that are US-bound,\" an official said.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-16 08:12:00','Reuters | Dec 16, 2017, 08:12 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:41'),(170,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/putin-says-us-gripped-by-fabricated-spymania-praises-trump/articleshow/62078129.cms','Putin says US gripped by fabricated spymania, praises Trump','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62078130,width-400,resizemode-4/62078130.jpg]','MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday the United States was in the grip of a fabricated spymania whipped up by President Donald Trumps opponents but he thought battered US-Russia relations would recover one day. Putin, who said he was on first name terms with Trump, also praised the US president for what he said were his achievements. \"Im not the one to evaluate the presidents work. That needs to be done by the voters, the American people,\" Putin told his annual news conference in Moscow, in answer to a question. \"(But) we are objectively seeing that there have been some major accomplishments, even in the short time he has been working. Look at how the markets have grown. This speaks to investors trust in the American economy.\" Trump took office in January, saying he was keen to mend ties which had fallen to a post-Cold War low. But since then, ties have soured further after US intelligence officials said Russia meddled in the presidential election, something Moscow denies. Congress is also investigating alleged contacts between the Trump election campaign and Russian officials amid allegations that Moscow may have tried to exercise improper influence. Putin dismissed those allegations and the idea of a Russia connection as \"fabricated.\" He shrugged off accusations that Russias ambassador to the United States had done something wrong by having contacts with Trump campaign figures saying it was \"international practice\" for diplomats to try to have contacts with all candidates in an election. \"What did someone see that was egregious about this? Why does it all have to take on some tint of spymania?,\" said Putin. \"This is all invented by people who oppose Trump to give his work an illegitimate character. The people who do this are dealing a blow to the state of (US) domestic politics,\" he added, saying the accusations were disrespectful to US voters. Moscow understood that Trumps scope for improving ties with Russia was limited by the scandal, said Putin, but remained keen to try to improve relations. \"Common threats\" Washington and Moscow had many common interests, he said, citing the Middle East, North Korea, international terrorism, environmental problems and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \"You have to ask him (Trump) if he has such a desire (to improve ties) ... or whether it has disappeared. I hope that he has such a desire,\" said Putin. \"We will normalise our relations and will develop (them) and overcome common threats.\" However, Putin lashed out at US policy on North Korea, warning a US strike there would have catastrophic consequences. In one of the most dramatic moments of the news conference, Ksenia Sobchak, a TV personality who has said she plans to run against Putin in a presidential election in March, asked him about what she said was the lack of political competition. Putin, 65, has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since the end of 1999. In particular, Sobchak asked about the case of opposition leader Alexei Navalny who looks unlikely to be allowed to run in the election due to what Navalny says is a trumped up criminal case. Putin, who polls suggest will be comfortably re-elected, warned that candidates like Navalny would destabilise Russia and usher in chaos if elected. \"Do you want attempted coups detat? Weve lived through all that. Do you really want to go back to all that? I am sure that the overwhelming majority of Russian citizens do not want this.\" Putin said the authorities were not afraid of genuine political competition and promised it would exist. Navalny, commenting on social media, said Putins response showed that barring him from taking part in next years presidential election was \"a political decision.\" \"Its like hes saying were in power and weve decided that it (Navalny running) is a bad idea,\" Navalny said. Putin disclosed he planned to run as an independent candidate and garner support from more than one party, in a sign the former KGB officer may be keen to strengthen his image as a \"father of the nation\" rather than as a party political figure. Putin named as priority issues nurturing a high-tech economy, improving infrastructure, healthcare, education and productivity and increasing peoples real incomes. He coughed his way through the first part of the news conference at times, and misread a placard held up by a journalist which he incorrectly thought said \"Bye Bye Putin,\" an error he quipped was due to age affecting his eyesight.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-15 09:14:00','Reuters | Dec 15, 2017, 09:14 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:42'),(171,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-federal-communications-commission-set-to-reverse-net-neutrality-rules/articleshow/62074715.cms','US Federal Communications Commission set to reverse net neutrality rules','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62074711,width-400,resizemode-4/62074711.jpg]','WASHINGTON: The US Federal Communications Commission is expected on Thursday to rescind net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that barred the blocking or slowing of internet traffic. The 2015 rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing access to content or charging consumers more for certain content. They were intended to ensure a free and open internet, give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content. Chairman Ajit Pai proposes allowing those practices as long as they are disclosed. Internet service providers clashed with Democrats and celebrities like \"Star Wars\" actor Mark Hamill ahead of a vote this week as the battle over net neutrality stretched from Hollywood to Washington. Protesters including some members of Congress are expected to rally outside the FCC in Washington before the vote. Pais proposal marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get. It is a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules. Michael Powell, a former FCC chairman who heads a trade group representing major cable companies and broadcasters, told reporters that internet providers would not block content because it would not make economic sense and consumers would not stand for it. \"They make a lot of money on an open internet,\" Powell said, adding it is \"much more profitable\" than a closed system. \"This is not a pledge of good-heartedness, its a pledge in the shareholders interest.\" A University of Maryland poll released this week found that more than 80 percent of respondents opposed the proposal. The survey of 1,077 registered voters was conducted online by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland from Dec. 6-8. Democrats have said the absence of rules would be unacceptable and that they would work to overturn the proposal if it is approved. Advocates of the net neutrality rules also plan a legal challenge. Pais proposal is \"like letting the bullies develop their own playground rules,\" said Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. Many Republicans back Pais proposal but want Congress to write netneutrality rules. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the FCC would \"return the internet to a consumer-driven marketplace free of innovation-stifling regulations.\" A group of nearly 20 state attorneys general asked the FCC to delay the vote until the issue of fake comments is addressed.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-14 23:20:00','Reuters | Dec 14, 2017, 23:20 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:42'),(172,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/hunger-at-the-doors-of-damascus-as-government-blocks-aid/articleshow/62074304.cms','Hunger at the doors of Damascus, as government blocks aid','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62074517,width-400,resizemode-4/62074517.jpg]','BEIRUT: At the doors of the Syrian capital, children with wrinkled faces and arms like sticks are going hungry because President Bashar Assads forces, supported by Russia and Iran, are blocking trucks filled with humanitarian relief. As the government and its opponents wrap up another fruitless round of talks in Geneva, humanitarian officials warn that conditions outside Damascus have reached crisis levels, with the government maintaining a siege on the eastern Ghouta suburbs that has trapped close to 4,00,000 people without enough food, fuel or medicine for the winter. They say patients with empty stomachs and kidney failure are dying in their beds waiting for evacuation to hospitals just minutes away. The fighting in Syrias nearly seven-year war has tapered off in many areas since local cease-fires took hold, but the suffering in eastern Ghouta _ Damascus once fertile hinterland, now cut off from the world _ has only gotten worse. According to the UN, roughly one in eight children are malnourished in eastern Ghouta _ a shocking jump from one in 50 in May. A top UN humanitarian official for Syria, Jan Egeland, said last week the government is refusing to allow convoys in. It has also refused to approve a list of nearly 500 people urgently needing medical evacuation. \"We have people here who are only eating a meal every two or three days, Ismael Yasin, a member of eastern Ghoutas local council told The Associated Press via Skype. \"Peoples faces are turning yellow from hunger. The siege cast a cloud over the eighth round of UN-sponsored talks in Geneva, which concluded Thursday without any results. The head of the oppositions delegation, Nasr Hariri, said the impasse on Ghouta reflected the international communitys \"shame, impotence, and dereliction. \"Its shameful that we have to go into negotiations so that they (the government) give us some loaves of bread, said Hariri. The UN envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, called the Ghouta blockade and others like it a \"medieval approach to war. Amnesty International said last month that the governments use of sieges against civilians - a tactic it called \"surrender or starve - was a crime against humanity. But the tactic has proven brutally effective for the government, which in the last two years has managed to recapture a constellation of towns around Damascus using the same playbook. In Zabadani and Daraya, the government executed its strategy so completely that it managed to completely depopulate the two towns, which had a combined population of about 100,000 people before the war. The government has followed the same strategy to restore its authority over the cities of Aleppo and Homs. The government denies besieging opposition areas, saying the militants, who it refers to as \"terrorists, withhold aid. At least three rebel factions still claim a presence in eastern Ghouta, and send shells whistling into the capital on a daily basis. In mid-November, a powerful faction called Ahrar al-Sham captured parts of a military base in the region, prompting the government to respond with waves of airstrikes and shelling that killed over 200 civilians, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Ahrar al-Sham said it attacked the base in response to the deteriorating humanitarian situation. Shortages have gotten so dire that residents are eating out of the trash and parents are skipping meals so their children can eat, Jakob Kern, the World Food Programs top official in Syria, told The Associated Press. \"They look exhausted, they look tired, and there is this despair in their eyes, said Kern, who entered eastern Ghouta with one of the few aid convoys the government has allowed in recent weeks. The convoys have provided just a trickle of relief - supplies for tens of thousands of people that will last only a month or less, at a time when hundreds of thousands are in need. Photos from eastern Ghouta show children gaunt with hunger, their skin wrinkled and aged. Mothers are not producing milk to feed their infants, and baby formula is too scarce and expensive for most families to afford. Driven by desperation, some residents are trying to eat animal fodder. Since at least 2015, there have been Syrians dying every winter of starvation and other medical ailments made worse by the bitter cold. Families in besieged areas, as well as camps for the displaced, burn furniture, plastics, and even the door frames and roof supports of their homes to cook and stay warm, as the cost of fuel has soared far beyond reach for most. Much of the country, including the hilly terrain around Damascus, sees freezing rain and snow in the winter months. Egeland said last week that 12 people have died waiting for medical evacuation from eastern Ghouta. They were on a UN-drawn list first submitted six months ago that has yet to be approved by the government, and now contains 494 names. The UNs children agency said Sunday that 137 children require immediate evacuation for conditions that include kidney failure, severe malnutrition and conflict wounds. Egeland, in pointed remarks in Geneva, placed full blame on the government for impeding aid shipments across the country. Eastern Ghouta saw large protests in the early days of the 2011 Arab Spring uprising against Assad. Government forces surrounded the area in 2013, but for most of the last four years, they turned a blind eye to tunnels and above-ground smuggling. Activists say local commanders made huge sums of money from checkpoint bribes, and traders got rich selling to a captive market. Patches of farmland also provided some food. The government tightened the noose this year, closing the tunnels and nearly all the crossings. Food in eastern Ghouta at one point was up to 85 times more expensive than in Damascus, just a few minutes drive away, according to the WFP. \"We need for the siege to be lifted, said Anas al-Dimashqi, a local media activist. \"Not just in front of the cameras, as the government does every now and then.','WORLD-MIDDLE-EAST','','2017-12-14 23:12:00','AP | Updated: Dec 14, 2017, 23:12 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:43'),(173,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-harry-to-marry-actress-meghan-markle-on-may-19/articleshow/62086104.cms','Prince Harry to marry actress Meghan Markle on May 19','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62086258,width-400,resizemode-4/62086258.jpg?imglength=43833]','LONDON: Britains Prince Harry will marry his fiancee Meghan Markle on May 19, Kensington Palace announced on Friday.

The anticipated clearance will provide a welcome boost to British Prime Minister Theresa May, who earlier this week lost a key parliamentary vote over giving lawmakers the final say on the Brexit deal before Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. May received a round of applause from EU leaders on Thursday night after giving her assessment of progress in the talks. In a breakthrough last week, the two sides agreed that the first round of issues in the Brexit talks had advanced sufficiently for now. These involved Britains divorce payment, keeping the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland open and sorting out citizens rights following Brexit. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said, \"some of us thought, including me, that she did make big efforts and this has to be recognized. Maltas prime minister, Joseph Muscat, echoed that view, saying \"there was appreciation from everyone, despite admitting concerns in the EU about developments in London. Mays first priority in the next phase of talks is to establish a transition period, likely involving Britain remaining part of the single market and the customs union and probably lasting about two years. A transition period would ease Britain out of the EU and provide some certainty to business. Many British firms, particularly in the finance sector, have warned that they might put contingency plans in place soon that could involve them relocating activities into the EU. During any transition, the EU is demanding that London should give up its seat at the leaders table, lose all its lawmakers in the European Parliament and remove its judges from Europes courts. However, it would still have to obey EU laws and respect the primacy of the European Court of Justice. Trade talks may be held after Friday, but no trade agreement between the EU and Britain can be finalized until after the transition period. While sympathizing with May, leaders said they wanted the British prime minister to provide more details on what she is looking for both in the transition period and in the future relationship. \"We need a little bit more clarity from the UK; what type of relationship we shall be entering into, said Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. \"She is having to cope with all sorts of pressure, he said.

Khan, 65, the Chief of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party was facing allegations of hiding his assets, owning offshore company and running the party with the help of foreign funding. The court disqualified Khans close aide for life and PTI Secretary General Jahangir Khan Tareen in the same case. The case was launched last year at the request by Hanif Abbasi, a leader of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, against Khan and Tareen. The three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, held around 50 hearings, while the case continued for more than a year. Over 7,000 documents were presented in the court by the petitioner and the accused. In the short judgement, Nisar said that all allegations against Khan have been rejected, including foreign funding allegation for his property and alleged wrongdoing in purchase Khans estate of Bani Gala near Islamabad. But Tareen was held responsible for fraud and disqualified for life. Nisar said that the bench had carefully examined all the evidence. The chief justice ruled that Khan was not disqualified as a parliamentarian as the petitioner was not directly affected in the foreign funding case. The court also ruled that the Election Commission of Pakistan will impartially investigate the foreign funding claims against the PTI chief by scrutinising accounts up till five years ago. The judgement states that Imran was not bound to declare his offshore company, declared his London flat in an amnesty scheme and that his former wife Jemima gave Imran the funds for buying the Bani Gala estate. Reacting to the verdict, Khan noted that it took the court one year to decide the case which was filed by a person wanted in a drug case - a reference to a case against Abbasi. \"There is no comparison in my case with Nawaz Sharifs, as Sharif is a money launderer but I earned money abroad and brought it back to Pakistan,\" he told reporters at the Karachi airport. He expressed joy at his exoneration but regretted that his aide Tareens disqualification. \"Tareen was disqualified on technical grounds,\" he said. Meanwhile, PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhry said the party will file an appeal. \"We will file a review petition against disqualification of Tareen,\" Chaudhry told reporters. The court had completed hearing and reserved the judgement on November 14. Both Khan and Tareen had rejected the charges and also announced to accept the court verdict. It was the second major case involving the leader of a leading political party. Earlier, the Supreme Court had disqualified Nawaz Sharif for corruption, leading to his ouster.

Powerful tremors lasted as much as 30 seconds in places.

Xi made his comments to visiting South Korean President Moon Jae-in after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered on Tuesday to begin direct talks with North Korea without pre-conditions. But the White House said on Wednesday that no negotiations could be held until North Korea improved its behaviour. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tillersons offer of direct contacts with North Korea was \"a very good signal\" while warning that any US strike on the country would have catastrophic consequences. Putin and US President Donald Trump discussed North Korea during a phone call, the White House and Kremlin said in separate statements. The two leaders talked about \"working together to resolve the very dangerous situation,\" the White House said on Thursday. Tillerson is to attend a UN Security Council ministerial meeting on North Korea in New York on Friday at which he plans to urge countries to maintain a US-led campaign to pressure Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs through sanctions. North Korea tested its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile on Nov. 29, which it said could put all of the United States within range, in defiance of international pressure and UN sanctions. The United States has said all options were on the table in dealing with North Korea, including military action. Meeting in Beijings Great Hall of the People, Xi told Moon the goal of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula must be stuck to, and war and chaos cannot be allowed, Chinese state media said. \"The peninsula issue must, in the end, be resolved via dialogue and consultation,\" Xi was cited as saying. China and South Korea have an important shared interest in maintaining peace, and China was willing to work with South Korea to promote talks and support North and South to improve relations, Xi said. South Koreas Yonhap news agency said Xi and Moon agreed war on the peninsula would not be tolerated and they would cooperate in applying sanctions and pressure on North Korea. The apparently warm tone of their talks followed nearly a year of tense relations between the two countries. THAAD issue China has been furious about the deployment of the US-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, saying its powerful radar can see far into China. China and South Korea agreed in October to normalise exchanges and move past the dispute, which froze trade and business exchanges. Xi reiterated Chinas position on THAAD and said he hoped South Korea would continue to \"appropriately handle\" the issue. Guterres, speaking to reporters in Tokyo after meeting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said Security Council resolutions on North Koreas nuclear and missile programmes must be fully implemented by Pyongyang and other countries. He said he expected Fridays Security Council meeting would deliver a strong expression of unity and the need for diplomacy to resolve the issue. \"The worst possible thing that could happen is for us all to sleepwalk into a war,\" he said. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said after meeting Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono in London on Thursday that military options in North Korea did not look attractive and the best way forward was to intensify economic pressure. Both China and Russia have welcomed Tillersons apparent overture. Putin said a US strike on North Korea would have catastrophic consequences and that he hoped to work with Washington eventually to resolve the crisis. Putin told a news conference that Russia did not accept North Koreas nuclear status, but some US actions had provoked North Korea. \"We believe the two sides should now stop aggravating the situation,\" he said. North Korea justifies its weapons programmes as necessary defence against US plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention. North Koreas state news agency KCNA said Trump was taking a big step towards nuclear war in seeking a naval blockade and North Korea would take \"merciless self-defence\" measures if the United States tried to impose one. North Korea would regard a naval blockade as \"an act of war\" and a \"wanton violation\" of its sovereignty and dignity, the agency cited a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying, while reiterating that North Korea was a responsible nuclear power that would fulfil its non proliferation commitments. It was not immediately clear if the latter remark was a response to Tillersons statement this week that Washington could not accept Pyongyang as a nuclear power as it was a proliferation risk. Washington has not publicly called for a blockade of North Korea, but has sought tougher UN steps, including non-consensual inspections of shipping to North Korea. Stepped-up UN Security Council sanctions imposed in September after North Koreas sixth nuclear test called on states to inspect vessels on the high seas, with the consent of the flag state, if they had reasonable grounds to believe the ships were carrying prohibited cargo. A tougher US-drafted resolution was watered down to win the support of Russia and China.','WORLD-REST-OF-WORLD','','2017-12-15 08:45:00','Reuters | Dec 15, 2017, 08:45 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:47'),(180,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iraq-hangs-38-members-of-islamic-state-qaida-for-terrorism/articleshow/62072703.cms','Iraq hangs 38 members of Islamic State, Qaida for terrorism','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62072763,width-400,resizemode-4/62072763.jpg]','NASIRIYAH: Iraq hanged 38 jihadists belonging to the Islamic State (IS) group or al-Qaida for terrorism offences on Thursday in the southern city of Nasiriyah, provincial authorities said.

Besides the jail term, the special court also imposed a fine of Rs 25 lakh on Koda and Rs one lakh on Gupta. Former Jharkhand chief secretary AK Basu and Vijay Joshi, a close aide of the then chief minister, were also awarded jail term of three years for indulging in corrupt practices and hatching criminal conspiracy in allocation of Rajhara North coal block in Jharkhand to a Kolkata-based private company, Vini Iron and Steel Udyog Ltd (VISUL). Special judge Bharat Parashar convicted the private firm and imposed a fine of Rs 50 lakh on it. The convicts including Koda, however, were granted statutory bail for a period of two months to enable them to file appeals in the Delhi High Court challenging the conviction and the jail term. The court, however, acquitted four persons - VISULs Director Vaibhav Tulsyan and two public servants Basant Kumar Bhattacharya and Bipin Bihari Singh and chartered accountant Navin Kumar Tulsyan - of all charges. All were earlier summoned as accused after the court took cognisance of alleged offences under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) read with 420 (cheating) and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servants) of IPC and under provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act. The CBI alleged that the firm had applied for allocation of Rajhara North coal block on January 8, 2007. It said although the Jharkhand government and the steel ministry did not recommend the VISULs case for coal block allocation, the 36th Screening Committee recommended the block to the accused firm. The CBI said that Gupta, who was chairman of the screening committee, had allegedly concealed facts from then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who then headed the coal ministry too, that Jharkhand had not recommended VISUL for allocation of a coal block. Koda, Basu and two accused public servants conspired to favour VISUL in the coal block allocation, the agency had alleged. The accused have refuted the allegations levelled against them.

Based on the analysis of these deficits in various sections, CSE has recommended four major areas that DMF in Ramgarh should invest in over the next three to five years through proper planning. Heres a list: Clean and sustainable drinking water supply The ground and surface water in Ramgarh district is highly polluted due to various industrial activities in the region and industrial discharge. Groundwater pollutants in Ramgarh district include heavy metals like iron, lead, cobalt. Levels of fluoride are also high. To make matters worse, 70-80 per cent households in rural mining areas rely on untreated water sources such as hand pumps and uncovered wells. In rural mining areas like Gola, only about 2 per cent households have access to treated tap water. During the discussion, people from the district raised their concern about non-availability of clean drinking water. The district, following directions of the Jharkhand Government, is allocating a major part of its DMF money for piped water supply to households, said district officials. This is about Rs. 600 crores over next 3 years. While ensuring water supply is important, will relying only on piped water supply help people get clean (treated) and adequate water over long run? CSE recommended that supplying treated clean water supply to households in mining areas be made a priority. This should also be ensured in schools, anganwadis and healthcare facilities and hospitals. The district can even rope in specialized agencies to provide technological assistance for water treatment. \"The viability of water supply solely through piped supply and taking water from surface sources such as the Damodar river must be re-examined. The available water from Damodar river is already stretched to its limits due to high water intake by industries\" said Banerjee. Locals present at the meeting and during ground interactions point out that Damodar river over the years has turned into a nallah. In such a scenario, how so many households in Ramgarh and its neighboring districts will get a sustained water supply from the river remains a key question. Moreover, it is crucial that the viability of the system be considered before/while planning investments. The district must also simultaneously look into sustainable approaches to ensure clean water supply to households, says CSE. The report suggests that along-term watershed based approach should be considered and the district should start making plans around it. Further mechanisms of rain water harvesting and other sustainable ways should be considered. Nutrition and public health One of the biggest concerns in the district is the high under 5 mortality rate (U5MR) of 35, particularly in rural areas. Another concern is the status of poor nutrition among children below the age of 5 years. In Ramgarhs rural areas, about 44% of children are stunted, 52% underweight. The intervention through ICDS and general healthcare is grossly insufficient. There is an acute shortage of Anganwadis in the district, with most of the existing AWCs currently serving 2.5 to three times their capacity. Many of them also lack the basic infrastructure such as drinking water facilities and proper toilets. The sub-optimal public health system of the district further compounds the problem. The district, for example, is acutely short of primary health centres (PHCs). Most PHCs in mining-affected areas are currently serving 2.5 to three times their capacity. The district and the sub district hospital, the point of more specialized public health access, are only semi-functional. In addition, there is a shortage of doctors, huge shortage of staff nurses, and health technicians. Considering these challenges, CSE recommends that the district should use DMF funds to improve nutrition status and healthcare access for people in the region. For nutrition, add-on support should be provided to ICDS to fill-in and improve upon the current shortfalls. For healthcare facilities in primary care, PHCs need to be increased by at least 50% to improve first point of contact. The deficits in health staff, particularly doctors and nurses can be filled in by contracting in trained staff, and offering competitive salary. The district should be given control over setting benchmarks and ensuring compliance of service delivery conditions. Further, demand side financing can improve health access of the poor. People who are BPL or those earning below Rs. 5,000 per month, can be given health vouchers so that they can afford better healthcare. \"These are some of the important steps to ensure that the health facilities are well resourced and health issues in the region are addressed effectively,\" said Banerjee. Education While the literacy in Ramgarh district is 73.2%, comparable to the national average, it is the level of education among people that remains a concern.Though majority of people complete elementary level education in the region, the gross enrolment rate at the secondary level drops by 40%. Also, in the 20-39 years age group, only 18.4% have completed higher secondary education and just above 15% are graduates. Poor secondary school infrastructure is an issue in the district. More than 50% habitations in mining-affected Patratu block do not have a secondary school located within the 5 kilometer radius, specified the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA). More importantly, the existing schools do not have enough teachers as reflected in the poor Pupil teacher ratio (PTR). To address these educational deficits, CSE recommends improving the number and quality of teachers in schools, providing educational scholarships, expanding on the network of schools, particularly in distressed areas. For instance, in order to reduce the overall drop-out rate at secondary level, the National means cum Merit Scholarship scheme can be strengthened through DMF. For SC/ST children, Post Matric scholarships can be built upon. Employment and livelihood Ramgarh district has a high proportion of non-workers. In the working age-group (15-59 years), about 50% people are not working. Additionally, about 29% people do not have full-time employment. Participation of women in work-force is poor. About 70% non-workers in the working age-group are women. Apart from a large number of marginal and non-workers, the income levels of those in the working group are not satisfactory. About 70% rural households in the district earn below Rs. 5,000 a month. Though the district has high potential for agriculture, with gross cropped area around 45%, peoples earning from agriculture in rural areas remains low due to pollution and low water availability. The districts water budget shows high water stress in the region which is likely to get worse. In the next four years, the water demand in Ramgarh is estimated to be five times the current water availability, further adding to the woes. \"The district must improve on the potential of agriculture based livelihood to secure peoples earnings\" said Srestha Banerjee. The long-term watershed approach can also serve this purpose added Banerjee. To improve overall employability, CSE recommends that the district must focus on better education particularly at secondary and post-secondary level, skill development that can get employment, investing in micro enterprises and supporting entrepreneurship, supporting agriculture-based livelihood and supporting better pricing for forest products. CSE also recommends that DMFs should consider convergence with various plans/programmes of the Centre and state governments and integrate them into the DMF plans. \"Funds like DMF need proper investment planning which requires analyzing issues collectively, understanding peoples needs and looking into scientifically and economically viable best practices. DMF planning must be systematic and bottom-up\" said Banerjee. The CSE report is based on the assessment of official district data as well as a month-long ground survey. During ground survey, discussions were held with various people in the mining affected area: these included different caste groups, women, PRI members, block development officials, frontline workers among others.','CITY-RANCHI','Ajanta Chakraborty','2017-12-13 15:05:00','| TNN | Dec 13, 2017, 15:05 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:51'),(189,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/court-breather-to-congress-mla-wife-in-dhenga-firing-case/articleshow/62048378.cms','Road lesson: Break rule, play mentor','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62049025,width-400,resizemode-4/62049025.jpg]','RANCHI: A group of 20 traffic violators were herded together on a traffic island on Tuesday and one of them was called out to address and advise the remaining and other members of the public on the risks and illeffects of disobeying traffic rules.

In his address, Pandey congratulated Nirmala College on being awarded an \"A\" certificate by NAAC and CPE by the UGC. \"Because of the excellent academic levels achieved by Ranchi University at the East Zone level Youth Festival last year, the University has been bestowed the honour of hosting the 33rd National Level Youth Festival come February 2018,\" he said.','CITY-RANCHI','','2017-12-15 14:09:00','TNN | Updated: Dec 15, 2017, 14:09 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:53'),(192,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/man-kills-minor-daughter-for-resisting-sexual-advances/articleshow/62039820.cms','Man kills minor daughter for resisting sexual advances','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62048560,width-400,resizemode-4/62048560.jpg]','JAMSHEDPUR: A man was sent to jail on Monday for killing and burying his 12-year-old daughter who resisted his sexual advances. Seraikela-Kharaswan police arrested Zafar Hussein recently for committing the heinous crime. The incident took place on October 19 but it came to light only on December 10 when the mother, Shaeen, approached police. Hussein, who is in his late 30s, confessed his crime after police grilled him for nearly 24 hours. Following his confession, the sleuths dug up the ground behind his house located at Babudungi under Kapali outpost of Chandil police station area to recover the girls body. Later, the remains were sent to MGM Hospital for post-mortem. The pervert father had tried to mislead police saying he killed the child for not pursuing her studies properly. He had also claimed that her daughter, who was studying in Class 9 in a local private school, repeatedly talked to her male friends over the phone despite his objections. Contrary to his claims, the mother made a shocking revelation to police alleging that Hussein repeatedly forced their minor child to agree to his sexual advances, but she kept resisting him. After finding it difficult to cope with the difficult situation, the deceased had narrated the ordeal to her mother in the first week of October. Infuriated over the insane conduct of her husband, Shaeen had a fight with him and asked him to mend his ways. Hussein, instead of mending his ways, warned his wife of dire consequences if she ever dared to reveal the incident to the in-laws or other relatives. A few day later, when Shaeen suffered from high fever, her husband, who had been in jail about a decade ago for the murder of his brother in-law, mixed several sleeping pills with anti-fever tablets and made her consume it. When Shaeen was in deep sleep that night, Hussein killed his daughter and buried the body behind his house. The next day when Shaeen regained her consciousness, her husband told her that the girl has been admitted to a residential school in Ranchi which allowed interaction with parents only once a month. Suspecting that something was wrong after she cannot make any communication with their daughter for several weeks, Shaeen confronted her husband on December 8. Hussein, however, threatened to kill her if she asked him again. Fearing for her life, she secretly fled to her in-laws place in Chaibasa. On last Sunday, she went to police and lodged a complaint. \"The accused has been sent to jail but the post-mortem report is awaited,\" Kapali outpost station in-charge Lal Bihari Prasad said. The report will confirm whether the deceased was raped before she was killed, he said. Hussein, who works in a construction company, has three children including a minor son. The deceased is the eldest among her siblings.','CITY-RANCHI','B Sridhar','2017-12-13 11:08:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 13, 2017, 11:08 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:53'),(193,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/uidai-to-jharkhand-take-action-if-ration-denied-over-aadhaar/articleshow/62091868.cms','UIDAI to Jharkhand: Take action if ration denied over Aadhaar','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62105323,width-400,resizemode-4/62105323.jpg]','RANCHI: The Unique Identification Authority of India has directed the principal secretary of the Jharkhand governments food and public distribution department to ensure necessary action as per law by the competent authority in the matter of rations denied to a beneficiary owing to non-linkage of ration card with Aadhaar.

Even before entering the House, several MLAs of the ruling party, BJP, started criticising Simon Marandi, the JMM MLA from Littipara, for reportedly making the tribal couples display affection publicly. They said the festival went against the tribal culture and tradition. The sessions inauguration was earlier predicted to be stormy with the opposition ready to corner the government for its decision to conduct the winter sittings for only four days. However, the Littipara event, organized at Dumariya village of Pakur district, has seemingly taken the sting out of the oppositions attack. After the session, state minister of social welfare, women and child development Louis Marandi said, \"I belong to the Santhal community and as far as I know such a festival is not part of our tribal culture.\" Even JMM MLA from Baharagora, Kunal Sarangi, chose to distance himself and his party from the festival. Speaking to media persons after the session, Sarangi said, \"The event was organised by a private organisation and the party had nothing to do with it.\" However, Marandi defended the festival which he had allegedly given support. \"The event Dulor Cho was organised by a village committee and I had been invited to attend it. Dulor Cho means kiss of love and such events have been organised in the past too. The event was meant for married tribal couples. \"I feel that this event is now quite necessary for the tribal masses because of the growing number of divorces in our community. Such events will strengthen us. We should all take it in a positive manner and not politicise it. Adivasi communities now need the support of society in expressing their love and freedom in all aspects of life. Even today, tribals are timid by nature and are unable to stand up confidently in front of outsiders. Such programmes will help them get over their inhibitions,\" Marandi said. However, JMM supremo Shibu Soren hasnt taken the event lightly given BJP criticism. Soren served a showcause notice to Marandi asking him to submit a written explanation on the controversy within seven days. Earlier during the session, Pradeep Yadav, the JVMP MLA from Poraiyahat, and some other legislators of the opposition demanded that the four-day winter session be extended to discuss contentious issues. The proposal, however, did not find any favour with the Assemblys business advisory committee. \"The duration of the session is immaterial. We should focus on optimum utilisation of the time that we have to work for welfare of the people,\" chief minister Raghubar Das commented on the oppositions proposal. While addressing the media, Sarangi criticised the governments decision to take control of liquor sales in the state. \"The state government should open a liquor shop on the Assembly premises. Now that it has stooped to the level of selling liquor to the masses, what is the harm in setting up an outlet here too?\" he quipped. Later, the assembly was adjourned till Wednesday after obituary references.','CITY-RANCHI','Sourav Mukherjee','2017-12-13 12:09:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 13, 2017, 12:09 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:54'),(195,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/cake-pastry-shops-usher-in-spirit-of-christmas/articleshow/62049037.cms','Cake, pastry shops usher in spirit of Christmas','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62049174,width-400,resizemode-4/62049174.jpg]','By: Debjani Chakraborty RANCHI: With less than a fortnight to go, Christmas shopping has started in the state capital in full swing with shops dotted across the city luring the customers with fancy Christmas decor and delicious baked goodies to munch on.

Those booked will have to appear for hearings and face legal action initiated by the courts concerned. JNAC authorities said on-the-spot fine will be imposed on people found spitting in public places, sticking pictures on public walls, urinating or defecating in the open and parking vehicles in no parking zones. Besides, traders found guilty of not keeping dustbins at their shops will also be liable to pay fines. Kumar said the week-long special drive that commenced on Sunday will deal strictly with habitual offenders. The officer said the purpose behind filing FIRs under IPC is to discipline them. \"We do not want to create hassles for them but to make them accountable in keeping the city clean,\" he said. \"Keeping the city clean is a collective responsibility of all stakeholders and I appeal to the denizens to help the municipal body in achieving the objective of cleanliness,\" the officer added.

Last week, NHAIs contracted company, Ramky Infrastructure Limited, engaged its earthmovers and heavy machinery to prepare ground for the road in Hazaribag facing the scenic Canary Hills. The bypass will cross the Canary foothills and divert the load of highway traffic from the main thoroughfares of Haribagh town. During the process, it damaged the hillock on which the heritage structure stood. Several trees, which are centuries old have also come under the axe because of the construction work, Gibraltars chief trustee Debal Mallick said. \"The heritage structure was constructed by my grandfather Justice SC Mallick, Indian Civil Service (ICS) and judge of Calcutta High Court in 1913 and till date we have been preserving this building as it has heritage value for the district and the state as well,\" Mallick said. He said the petition filed in the court in March this year sought a direction to the NHAI to spare the property and the hillock to preserve the natural surroundings of the century-old building. The petitioners counsel had also argued in court that the road work would also damage the nearby Houlton Park, constructed by the last British collector of Hazaribag, Sir John Houlton. Convener of the Indian National Trust for Cultural Heritage (INTACH), Hazaribag chapter, Bulu Imam, has also been campaigning for preservation of the building and its natural surroundings. He has written to the Prime Ministers Office seeking its intervention so that the structure could be protected. Imam said Houlton in his book titled — Bihar the heart of India —explicitly described the beauty of the place and had constructed a park to form a miniature national park and conserve the ecology. He argued that the road can be realigned so as to spare the natural landscape which also includes an elephant megalith dating back to around 3,000 BC. Hazaribag deputy commissioner Ravi Shukla, however, said the district administration was ready to protect the building but a part of the compound has to be compromised. \"We are not touching the building but a part of the boundary is coming under the project,\" he said. Shukla added that since there was no stay from court, the authorities have the legal power to go ahead with the project. District land acquisition officer Shabbir Ahmed also said the authorities were ready to hold talks with the Mallicks to sort out the issue. \"On their request, NHAI had once changed alignment of the road and spared the building which was otherwise coming in the way of the bypass,\" he said. The projects director, Devendra Gupta, said, \"It is an old case of 2010 and they have moved the court. Still, we are open to talks but till then, we are constructing the road as per rules.\" Meanwhile, Mallick believes that realignment of the road, shifting it by around 80 mts from the building, can save the hillock and it would not be cumbersome for the NHAI. \"If they shift it slightly, it would fall on a plane land and will be off our plot. We have no objection to the highway project but the sentiments attached to the building can be protected by a little adjustment,\" he said. Mallick recollected that several noted Bengali movies had also been shot in the building. \"The 1961 movie, Agnisanskar, starring Uttam Kumar and Supriya Choudhary and the 1976 movie, Asomoy, starring Aparna Sen and Deepankar Dey were shot here,\" he said. The British had named Canary hill, Gibraltar of India because of its resemblance to the rock at Gibraltar and the building was named after it.','CITY-RANCHI','','2017-12-12 18:59:00','TNN | Updated: Dec 12, 2017, 18:59 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:56'),(198,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/registration-row-ranchi-university-students-union-polls-deferred-indefinitely/articleshow/62017474.cms','Registration row: Ranchi University students’ union polls deferred indefinitely','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62017516,width-400,resizemode-4/62017516.jpg]','RANCHI: Ranchi University vice-chancellor Ramesh Kumar Pandey on Sunday postponed the students union election for indefinite period amid raging controversies around the non-registration of 67,000 students for the varsity polls. Student groups claimed that the 67,000 students have not been registered in the current session leading to delayed declaration of results. The election rules specify that every student should have 75% attendance to be eligible to vote or contest elections. This factor had deemed a huge number of students ineligible for the students union elections. The university has had a tumultuous record with student union elections after it was postponed for nine years since 2007 and was held only after an initiative taken by the current VC in 2016. I n the 57 years of its existence, the university has been able to organise just three student union elections — one in 1987, another in 2007 and the last in 2016. The decision to postpone elections was taken on Sunday afternoon after two days of continuous protests by various youth wings of the political parties in the state. The decision was taken after a meeting of university officials including the registrar, dean of student welfare and the vice chancellor. The move was welcomed by the students, who were rallying around for an all-inclusive election. ABVP leader Atal Pandey said, \"Our apprehensions were proved right about the error in registrations of so many students. We condemn the recklessness of the officials in announcing the elections without verifying the enrolment status of students in the colleges.\" He added, \"The examination department was supposed to release the results for the students who appeared for semester-end exams this summer within 40 days, but the delay in declaration of results led to this discrepancy. The concerned officials should face action for toying with the future of these students.\" Exams postponed due to the elections across autonomous colleges affiliated to the university including Ranchi Womens College and Marwari College is expected to be reinstated. \"We will hold all our exams as per the earlier schedule now. Only the exams scheduled for December 11 will be held on a later date, as the notification of cancellation of elections came in late this afternoon,\" said Manju Sinha of Ranchi Womens College.','CITY-RANCHI','','2017-12-11 11:06:00','TNN | Dec 11, 2017, 11:06 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:56'),(199,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/mad-mad-world/new-algorithm-to-teach-robots-human-etiquettes/articleshow/59176215.cms','New algorithm to teach robots human etiquettes','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59176212,width-400,resizemode-4/59176212.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a new machine-learning algorithm to help robots display appropriate social behaviour in interactions with humans. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are making virtual and robotic assistants increasingly capable in performing complex tasks, researchers said. For these \"smart\" machines to be considered safe and trustworthy collaborators with human partners, however, robots must be able to quickly assess a given situation and apply human social norms, they said. Now, researchers at Brown University and Tufts University in the US have created a cognitive-computational model of human norms in a representation that can be coded into machines. They developed a machine-learning algorithm that allows machines to learn norms in unfamiliar situations drawing on human data. The project funded by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) represents important progress towards the development of AI systems that can \"intuit\" how to behave in certain situations in much the way people do. \"The goal of this research effort was to understand and formalise human normative systems and how they guide human behaviour, so that we can set guidelines for how to design next-generation AI machines that are able to help and interact effectively with humans,\" said Reza Ghanadan, DARPA programme manager. As an example in which humans intuitively apply social norms of behaviour, consider a situation in which a cell phone rings in a quiet library, researchers said. A person receiving that call would quickly try to silence the distracting phone, and whisper into the phone before going outside to continue the call in a normal voice. Today, an AI phone-answering system would not automatically respond with that kind of social sensitivity. \"We do not currently know how to incorporate meaningful norm processing into effective computational architectures,\" Ghanadan said, adding that social and ethical norms have a number of properties that make them uniquely challenging. Ultimately, for a robot to become social or perhaps even ethical, it will need to have a capacity to learn, represent, activate, and apply a large number of norms that people in a given society expect one another to obey, Ghanadan said. That task will prove far more complicated than teaching AI systems rules for simpler tasks such as tagging pictures, detecting spam, or guiding people through their tax returns. However, by providing a framework for developing and testing such complex algorithms, the new research could bring machines that emulate the best of human behaviour closer, researchers said.','WORLD-MAD-MAD-WORLD','','2017-06-18 12:39:00','PTI | Updated: Jun 18, 2017, 12:39 IST','2017-12-16 19:15:57'),(200,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/hospital-to-treat-sick-teddies-opens-in-dubai/articleshow/58880950.cms','Hospital to treat sick teddies opens in Dubai','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.comhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-58127550/toilogo.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.comhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-58127550/toilogo.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.comhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-58127550/toilogo.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.comhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-58127550/toilogo.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-58880983,width-400,resizemode-4/58880983.jpg]','DUBAI: A teddy bear hospital has been launched in the UAE where children can check-in with their sick teddies, the first of its kind facility in the UAE to help minors overcome anxiety while seeing a doctor. In the opening session, teddy bears underwent a CT scan, and were led into the surgery ward to get anaesthetics before their operation. The Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences (MBRU) here houses the hospital which is a part of a programme designed to teach school children hands-on about medical procedures and to decrease any preconceived fears of doctor visits, Khaleej Times reported. Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum attended the first session of the hospital along with four children. The Teddy Bear Hospital session kicked off with the children changing into their personalised scrubs. Then they were led to the Simulation Centre by the team and a number of MBRU medical students where they checked-in their teddy bears into the hospital. Upon admission, the children met the doctors to discuss their bears medical situation. They awaited their respective teddy bear at the observation room where they were brought out with an intravenous (IV) drip and bandages. They discussed with doctors their teddys medical results after getting medical reports and the image from the CT scan. The Teddy Bear Hospital merely began as an idea submitted to Mohammed Bin Rashid Smart Majlis titled \"Create a class in school to treat sick toys\", the report said. The idea was then directed to Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) for review. After studying the initial idea, the KHDA directed it to the MBRU in order to study its feasibility. The MBRUs simulation team re-engineered the initial idea and Teddy Bear Hospital came to life. Helen Henderson, lead simulation educator at MBRU said: \"Teddy Bear Hospital creates a unique educational opportunity for children across the UAE. Its a great initiative, and one of its kind in the country. The programme introduces children to the basics of healthcare through firsthand experiences where we aim to downplay the fear children experience when they go to hospitals\". \"We want to diminish any negative feelings of anxiety the children experience when visiting a doctor.

The boy had been suffering from a malignant tumour in his lower leg since 2013, which had grown to around eight inches between his ankle and foot. The boy underwent two surgeries in other hospitals in Goa and Mumbai prior to this one, which left him with an infected tumour. Unable to walk due to pain in the affected leg for a year, the boy, coming to the conclusion that amputation was the only solution, approached the Manipal Hospital. Consultant orthopaedic oncologist, Manipal Hospitals, Dr Srimanth B S, said the case was unique because of the location of the tumour — in the lower leg (distal tibia). The challenge, he said, was not only to remove the large infected tumour, but ensure the area was reconstructed in such a way that the foot would be functional, too. Senior consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Manipal Hospitals, Dr Deepchand Bhandare, said considering the boys complex case, a multidisciplinary approach was taken involving a lot of planning and many hours on the operating table.

But in recent incidents, a new modus operandi has been observed, which makes it nearly impossible to track the accused. Here, the accused, after sending victims huge salary offers, ask them to deposit money in a bank account as visa fees or work permit fees. These accounts are mostly based in northeastern states. The money is later found to be withdrawn from ATMs in a different state in India, before the fraud is discovered. Investigation by police reveals that both the mobile number and the bank accounts are created using fraudulent documents. The accused are also careful enough to make the ATM withdrawals while covering their face and, therefore, even footage of the ATM withdrawals obtained by Goa police have proved futile in revealing the identity of the accused. This has meant that most of these cases are likely to near an investigation deadend. In a recent case, a Goan man was duped of around Rs 34 lakh with a promise of employment abroad. The victims are preyed on using the profiles they upload on online job portals. \"Huge salary offers are made to the victims. They are then asked by the accused to deposit money in a given bank account as visa fees, work permit fees etc. As is the natural human tendency to be optimistic, the victims feel that they will soon more than recover the money they had to pay once they start working and receive the huge salary being promised,\" said SP crime branch Karthik Kashyap. He said that the accused are so refined in their act that the fake documents and receipts for payment being issued by them to the victims are extremely difficult to tell as fraudulent. \"We have gone to a great extent to solve such cases. Our personnel have gone to the northeastern states, where the bank accounts are based, only to discover that the addresses mentioned when the accounts were created do not even exist. At times, we have frozen such accounts. But even the footage of ATM withdrawals are pointless in cracking the case as the accused are careful enough to cover their faces each time,\" said Kashyap. He said that it is not just Goa, but such cases are being witnessed across the country. He said that often the victims also shell out the money because they are told that the amount would be refunded to them later. \"All I would like to say is that when you are asked to deposit money in return for a job, you should be alert,\" said Kashyap to jobseekers. While all such cases involving a fraud of more than Rs 5 lakh are handled by the cyber cell of the crime branch, officials said that there could be more cases involving smaller amounts which are reported at individual police stations or do not even reach stages of being reported. The victims are usually asked to deposit smaller amounts first, and when the accused feels that they have won over their confidence, a higher amount is demanded by the accused. In a recent complaint received by Porvorim police, a Socorro resident was offered a job in Canada and after being asked to deposit Rs 32,000 and Rs 75,000 on two occasions, was asked deposit another Rs 3.31 lakh to secure a Canadian travellers cheque. This is when the victim grew suspicious and approached the NRI commissioners office in the state secretariat, where to her horror she was told that the documents sent by the employer were fake. The bank account she was asked to deposit the money was based in Shillong, Meghalaya.','CITY-GOA','Gauree Malkarnekar','2017-12-16 13:53:00','| TNN | Dec 16, 2017, 13:53 IST','2017-12-16 19:16:05'),(216,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/families-of-assam-agitation-victims-pin-hopes-on-nrc-update-for-justice/articleshow/62081085.cms','Families of Assam Agitation victims pin hopes on NRC update for justice','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62081086,width-400,resizemode-4/62081086.jpg]','GUWAHATI: Thirty two years after the culmination of the anti-foreigners movement in the state, Kamal Nath, a local leader who lost his brother in the agitation, rued that the state has got universities and industries as fruits of the movement but the primary agenda of making the state free from illegal immigrants remains unaccomplished due to government apathy. Nath, who lives in Nagaon and is a school teacher by profession, now has his hopes pinned on the Supreme Court monitoring the updating of the 1951 National Register of Citizens, which is being done with the purpose of identifying all illegal immigrants in the state. Speaking to TOI, Nath said, \"Its tragic. The primary objective of making Assam free from illegal immigrants remains unfulfilled even after so many years. People of Assam have got eminent institutions in the fields of education and industry as an outcome of the movement. The movement was envisaged by many as an effort to usher in a golden era to the state, but the cause for which the martyrs laid down their lives remains unfulfilled.\" Nath lost his brother Narendra Kumar Nath during the agitation. Nath lamented that the Union home ministry, being the nodal ministry for implementation of the Assam Accord, should have taken more prompt initiatives. \"We can not blame the AGP government led by Prafulla Mahanta alone for the elongated delay in implementing the clauses of the Assam Accord because the Centre had to play the most important role in sealing the international border, updating the NRC and holding talks with Bangladesh to chalk out ways to stop cross-border infiltration,\" said Nath. Birinchi Kumar Sarma, who was the general secretary of the Charaibahi High School in central Assam during the agitation and went to jail in 1983 for picketing, said it is unfortunate how the students of the state shouldered the task of the state machinery by launching a vigorous movement against illegal infiltrators but their efforts came to nought due to the passivity of political leaders. \"At that time we never questioned the leadership of the movement. People were jumping into the agitation as the popular perception was that the Bangladeshis will encroach upon our lands and rights and we will be driven away from our own homeland. Even after the supreme sacrifice of so many people, the governments at the Centre and the state did not take the illegal immigrants issue seriously.

We believe Rahuls leadership will be able to steer the Congress in the fight against communal forces and BJP,\" Ajmal said here on Wednesday. Speaking about Congress election campaign in Gujarat, Ajmal said over the last few months, people have witnessed a perceptible change in Rahul Gandhi and his \"political maturity\" as far as challenging Modi and BJP is concerned. \"The transformation in Rahul Gandhi is obvious and has been witnessed by all. Even a skilled orator like Modi had to be in the defensive because of him. Once the butt of Pappu jokes, Rahul has now transformed into a leader who can challenge BJP and the communal forces with resoluteness. We are very confident that he will take forward the fight against the communal forces in an effective way,\" Ajmal observed. \"Of late, we have seen a sense of desperation in the ruling BJP in Gujarat with Rahul leading the charge for Congress. He was very effective in raising the anti-people policies of Modi government at the Centre as well as in the BJP-ruled state,\" he added. It is well known that AIUDF and Congress do not see eye-to-eye in Assam. But Ajmal is a part of the 18-party anti-BJP alliance led by the Congress and his association with the alliance has kept alive the possibilities of seeing a similar coalition in Assam. Though Congress has always denied any intention of joining hands with AIUDF, Ajmal has been speaking out on the importance of bringing secular parties together to take on BJP in Assam. Back in October this year, there was much speculation of an alliance of secular paties being formed to challenge the BJP in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Congress, however, has consistently maintained that it wants to keep its distance from both the BJP and AIUDF.

Puia, a darling of Mizorams table tennis fraternity, is a role model for many youngsters. The manufacture, possession and transportation of methaqualone is an offence under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. Methaqualone powder is processed to prepare mandrax, a recreational drug much in demand nowadays in African countries, said investigating officials. \"Mandrax is not much in demand in Mumbai as other banned substances are available in the local market.

All of them have been killed due to unnatural causes, with the primary reasons being mowing down by moving train, electrocution, poisoning and accidentally falling in ditches especially in tea garden areas. Herds of elephants have been regularly invading human settlements in search of food, damaging houses and crops in the process. As a result, incidents of man-animal conflict are steadily on the rise. \"Elephants are considered to be a problem as they damage crops and properties during the harvest season. Also, unlike rhinos or tigers, elephants are not a state or national animal. Therefore, they evoke less public sentiment even when they die,\" a conservationist, who did want to be named, pointed out. An excavator places the carcasses of two elephants, who according to forest officials were electrocuted early morning in a paddy field, for their burial at Kuruabahi village, in Nagaon district. He added that while public reaction is almost spontaneous in case of rhino deaths which are followed by strong condemnations and demands for exemplary punishment, the death of elephants fails to produce the same level of public outcry. \"Unfortunately, we dont see such outpouring of public support for elephants,\" he said. Bibhab Talukdar, secretary general of Aaranyak, an NGO that works on biodiversity conservation, said, \"It is very unfortunate that more than 40 elephants have died in the last 100 days. It clearly shows that elephants are not getting priority when it comes to conservation of animals.\" Flowers placed by locals on carcass of an elephant killed by electrocution in Nagaon district (Reuters Photo) While rhinos in the state are confined to national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, an estimated population of 500 elephants in Assam have habitats across all reserved forests. The state has five elephant reserves covering an estimated area of 10,967-sq km. Only a small portion of these reserves are in protected areas, in the form of national parks or wildlife sanctuaries, while the rest are reserved forest areas. Hojai district of Assam (PTI Photo) Conservationists pointed out that elephant reserves in the state do not enjoy the same level of protection as national parks.

The device will prevent many accidents from occurring while crossing roads when motorists honk and people with hearing disabilities are unable to hear it. Kaustav B Arya of Assam Jatiya Bidyalay here, along with his team from the same school, has developed the device which can convert the honk of a car into electricity and then trigger a vibration, thereby alerting the deaf person. The device can be developed for Rs 80 and can be attached to a persons wrist or arm. The device works through a condenser microphone attached to the shoulder of a challenged person. The sound is converted to electricity and passes through a circuit which filters all other sound frequencies, except the honking. The sound frequency of car honking then activates a vibrator, which helps in alerting the person that a vehicle is nearby. \"Usually, the frequency of a car horn is between 1 and 5 kilohertz. We have made it in such a way that it can cut off all ambient sound and pick up only the honk of a car.

It joins the Lohit and Dibang rivers to form the Brahmaputra. A large section of Assamese population is dependent on the Brahmaputra for day-to-day activities. Last week, the government admitted that the water is unfit for drinking. The student body demanded that the Centre expedite talks with China to resolve the matter. Construction work by China is believed to have polluted the waters though it has denied having any role. Aasu has already demanded Prime Minister Narendra Modis intervention into the issue.

It has, however, been an age-old practice for the Idu Mishmi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh. Till the early 90s, members of the tribe used to carry out a euthanasia-like practice for terminally ill members of the community. A research done by Tarun Mene, assistant professor of Arunachal Institute of Tribal Studies under Rajiv Gandhi University in Arunachal Pradesh and Sarit K Chaudhuri of Bhopal-based Indira Gandhi Rastriya Manav Sanghrahalaya, has revealed that the Idu Mishmis carried out their traditional euthanasia mainly by asphyxiation. Terminally ill persons going through extreme suffering were either buried alive or confined into a small room made of stone and plastered with mud to block the passage of air. Idu Mishmis are mainly concentrated in the Dibang valley and Lohit districts in eastern part of Arunachal Pradesh. The paper titled Euthanasia among the Idu Mishmis of Arunachal Pradesh: Understanding issues and concerns of a frontier tribe was published in the Journal of the Indian Anthropological Society last year. It pointed out that the Idu Mishmis used to opt for euthanasia only after the Shaman (Igu) had failed to cure a diseased person. The practice, locally known as Misi-muh, entailed an elaborate performance of rituals associated with death. \"The method used in assisting euthanasia among the Idu Mishmis is in sync with the prescribed custom of disposition of the dead among them. Since the dead has to be buried as per the prevailing custom, the same method is followed also in the case of assisting euthanasia,\" the paper points out. Mene, himself a member of Idu Mishmi community, said since the early 1990s, the practice has started dying down with the last instances of Misi-muh being held between 1990 and 1994. Mene attributed many reasons for this, such as the improvement of medical facilities which has made it possible to cure more diseases and also legal interventions. Mene, however, argues that with the dying out of the practice, there has been a rise in cases of suicides in the community. \"It is interesting that with the end of euthanasia, there has been a sharp rise in suicide cases in the community. I am now researching on this correlation. I have to find out why the stopping of euthanasia is leading to rise in suicides,\" he said. The researchers have traced 36 cases of different forms of euthanasia among the Idu Mishmi community. They collated the information by interviewing the members of the community.','CITY-GUWAHATI','Naresh Mitra','2017-12-13 10:49:00','| TNN | Dec 13, 2017, 10:49 IST','2017-12-16 19:16:15'),(235,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/ulfa-i-claims-hand-in-killing-father-son-duo/articleshow/62049365.cms','Ulfa-I claims hand in killing father-son duo','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62049366,width-400,resizemode-4/62049366.jpg]','GUWAHATI: The Ulfa (I) led by Paresh Baruah has claimed responsibility for the killing of a village defence party president and his son in Tinsukia district on Monday.

However, Bhushan Gagrani, chairman of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), which is implementing the project, told TOI they had so far acquired 2,800 hectares land till date. \"Along with governments own 1,000 hectares, MSRDC has in its possession a total of 3,800 hectares, which is about 40%.

In response to an environment interest litigation (EIL) filed by Sangli-based lecturer Ravindra Shinde through counsel Asim Sarode, the NGT bench of justice Umesh D Savi and expert member Nagin Nanda directed SLAC to recover the fine individually from every municipal commissioner and chief executive officer of local bodies which have not complied with the courts directives. According to the Plastic Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2016, it is mandatory for all the municipal councils and corporations to set up temporary places for deposit and collection of plastic waste. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), one of the respondents in the case, submitted to the court that only 193 out of 257 local bodies in the state have established such places. SLAC submitted that it has issued notices to the non-compliant bodies asking them to reply within 15 days. In his petition which has 234 respondents, Shinde has stated that in almost all the municipal areas of the state, plastic carry bags below 50 microns were being used and no stringent action was taken by any authority. The petition further stated that only six out of 23 municipal corporations have submitted the mandatory tri-monthly reports regarding action taken against production, distribution, sell and use of plastic bags below 50 microns to the principal secretary of state environment department. While the report of Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation indicates that no legal action has been taken against the violators, that of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) shows that around 20.86kg and 90.30kg of plastic bags below 50 microns were confiscated between January and March 2014 and October and December 2014 respectively. Also, Rs59,000 and Rs2.85 lakh were collected as fines during the same periods. Apart from this, Shinde pointed out that municipal corporations of Thane, Nagpur, Solapur, Pune, Navi Mumbai, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Kalyan Dombivali, Amravati and Aurangabad did not initiate any action against the businessman, retail shop keepers and other people engaged in using or distributing banned carry bags.

They want the import duty to be minimized to allow orange exporters to have a good market in countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka which are big importers of orange. High import duty increases the cost of the oranges so much that India cannot afford to export to these countries Since the import duty on orange in countries like China, Bhutan and Nepal is relatively very less, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh prefer to buy oranges from these countries. Hence, there is a need for Indian government to work in collaboration with Bangladesh and Sri Lankan government and ensure the required reduction in the import duty to facilitate export of oranges from Vidarbha. There is a high demand of oranges in the Gulf countries too. \"But the government is making no effort in creating favourable conditions for farmers to reach out to customers in these countries,\" the orange growers said. Ramesh Jichkar, director Shramjeevi Orange Farmers Producer Company, told TOI that the import duty in Bangladesh is as much as Rs30,000 per ton whereas the cost of orange is Rs20,000 per ton. This reduces the farmers benefit so much that neither they are keen on exporting nor the buyers are keen on buying the stock. \"Orange growers, for past many years, have been requesting government to negotiate the import duty with these neighbours. But somehow nothing has moved in the right direction,\" he said. Shridhar Thakre, director, Maha Orange, also said that the country needs to take a serious move in the direction of minimizing the import duties by Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Both the NGOs also want the state government to set up grading, packaging, cooling and storage unit at each taluka place where orange is grown in the region. \"If there are these units at taluka place, it saves a lot of transport charges to the district place or elsewhere. It also motivates the farmers to enter the system of exporting orange through these centres and earn more price for their produce,\" said Manoj Jawanjal, one of the directors of Maha Orange. Orange growers across the region are also upset that there is no improvement in quality of existing Nagpur mandarin. A single variety, which is good only as table fruit, is being grown for over 250 years. \"The Central Citrus Research Institute has not developed a single seedless variety of orange suitable for processing. In grapes, there are so many varieties with different brix (sweetness) as per demand of the importing countries.

He pointed out there was no reference of compensation due to bollworm attack in the insurance firms manual and, therefore, it wouldnt be advisable to depend on them. \"It is surprising that we are seeking guidance from Monsanto company, which was responsible for exploiting the farmers and raking moolah in crores,\" he said. Senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar asked the government to provide compensation out of its own kitty and not wait for Centres funds. \"There are no figures of panchnama on record. Poor farmers from Vidarbha, Marathwada and North Maharashtra need help. Government shouldnt wait for insurance firms, they may move courts if forced to pay.\" Jaiprakash Mundhada and Abdul Sattar sought reply on alternative to Bt seeds as current varietys resistance to pest had reduced. Samir Kunawar wanted to know when these companies would be blacklisted. Phundkar said the government would make the companies pay to the farmers. \"We had already sealed their godowns and lodged police complaints in many cases. We have already directed the research institutions, agriculture universities and Mahabeej to come up with new variety of seeds, which usually takes three years.\" Blaming the then Congress-NCP government, he said the first Bt variety was introduced in 2002 and second in 2006-07 during their tenure but they failed to make efforts to produce new varieties since then.','CITY-NAGPUR','Vaibhav Ganjapure','2017-12-16 13:27:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 13:27 IST','2017-12-16 19:16:20'),(244,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/pink-bollworm-crisis-hyped-by-oppn-cotton-arrival-more-than-last-yr-min/articleshow/62089765.cms','Pink bollworm crisis hyped by opposition, cotton arrival more than last year','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62094694,width-400,resizemode-4/62094694.jpg]','Nagpur: State agriculture minister Pandurang Phundkar said the report of the special investigation team (SIT), constituted for probing into pesticide inhalation deaths, will be tabled before the winter session ends. \"The report has been put up before chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for his scrutiny. In any case, it would be tabled before the house during the current session,\" Phundkar told TOI during an informal conversation. Poisoning due to accidental inhalation of pesticides has led to 44 deaths in Vidarbha. The highest toll has been in Yavatmal district, infamous for farmer suicides. The minister also blamed rampant use of plant growth regulators for the incidents. He said the chemicals have led to abnormal growth of cotton crop. One of the theories is that due to excessive height of the cotton crop, fumes of pesticides fell on workers face while spraying, leading to deaths. On the pink bollworm attack, Phundkar said pest infestation was not at the level of a crisis. \"The crisis is only a creation of the opposition. In fact, cotton production was higher than the last year,\" he said. According to figures quoted by Phundkar, market arrivals of cotton from October to December this year have exceeded previous years count for the same period by over 4 lakh quintals. This year, the total arrivals till the first two weeks of December stand at 98.31 quintals, the minister said. \"The arrivals in the month of November 2017 are double as compared to November 2016 at 40.95 lakh quintals. During December 2016, 70 lakh quintals of cotton reached the markets. This year, the figures collected till December 11 show arrivals at 53 lakh quintals. Over a fortnight remains for the month to end,\" said Phundkar. \"Figures show that cotton output is higher than the last year. I came across a farmer in Akola district who has harvested 600 quintals in his 80-acre farm. He is expecting another 800 quintals of yield through further picking. In my own constituency of Buldhana, the impact of bollworm is not in more than 5% of the area. The oppositions claims are hyped,\" he said. So far, 5 lakh farmers have filed complaints about Bt seeds failing against bollworm, said Phundkar. Kishore Tiwari, a former farmers activist and now the chairman of the state government think-tank Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), has countered Phundkars claims. He said the figures are misleading as the cotton crop has almost exhausted. \"Not much is expected to reach the markets after this. Last year, the total arrivals in the state stood at 388 lakh quintals. A year before, it was 297 lakh quintals. This year, the total arrivals are expected to be around 200 lakh quintals,\" Tiwari said. \"If we consider the incremental area of 10 lakh hectares which came under cotton this year, then the yields have been halved in 2017,\" said Tiwari. He said the governments plan to get compensation from seed companies for the bollworm attack is impractical. The companies can also challenge the move in the courts, he added.','CITY-NAGPUR','Shishir Arya','2017-12-16 13:34:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 13:34 IST','2017-12-16 19:16:20'),(245,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/decommissioned-aircraft-deepak-gifted-to-rsc/articleshow/62089761.cms','Decommissioned aircraft ‘Deepak’ gifted to RSC','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62089760,width-400,resizemode-4/62089760.jpg]','By Nisha Hirani NAGPUR: HPT 32 (HAL piston trainer 32), an aircraft popularly known as Deepak that was decommissioned from service, was gifted to Raman Science Centre and Planetarium (RSC) by Air Marshal Hemant Sharma, air-officer-commanding-in-chief, at a function held on Friday. HPT-32 is an Indian prop-driven primary trainer manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). Indias indigenously built HPT-32 Deepak by HAL was used for initial pilot training and other utility tasks. Deepak was developed by HAL for the Indian Air Force (IAF) to replace the tandem two-seat HT-2 basic trainer and undertake a range of other utility roles. Deepak first flew in 1981 and was delivered to IAF Training Command in 1984. Notably, many of the top IAF officers have trained on HPT-32. The prototype first flew on January 6, 1977. Sharma interacted with a group of school students at the RSC and explained to them various parts of aircraft. He also narrated the thrills associated with working for IAF and urged the children, especially girl students, to join the force.

Speaking to TOI, Gupta, said, \"As per the department which processes teachers salaries, there are 712 people who were hired from 2012 to 2016. But when I wrote to the secondary education department separately, they provided information about only 378 people. What happened to the remaining 334? Where are the records of these people?\" That is the question which the secondary education department is itself trying to answer. Sources in the department said that they have received the complaint from Gupta and as per standard procedure an inquiry has been started to see whether theres any truth to it. Gupta, said, \"Documents never lie and the two RTI replies which I have procured clearly point to a mismatch in personnel. I am convinced that these missing files relate to those teachers who were hired illegally by ignoring protocol.\" Gupta contends that the scam started in 2012 when a hiring freeze was put in place. Gupta, said, \"School trustees and education department seem to have conspired and taken bribes from these teachers and added them to the payroll.\" He added that teachers first start off as Shikshan Sevaks with a fixed stipend (ranging from Rs4,000-8,000 per month) for three years. \"After completion of three years, the school can regularize them by hiring as a full-time teacher. But education officials in Nagpur have allowed hiring of teachers even before the three years were complete. Its a scam worth crores of rupees and now they are all trying to cover it up by fudging records and misplacing files. Regardless, the RTI documents in my possession will contradict anything and everything they now try to cover up,\" said Gupta. None of the education officials agreed to speak with TOI citing protocol issues since the assembly session is underway. A source in the education department agreed that there is \"partial truth\" in Guptas allegations. \"The part that entire hiring process is illegal is not true because even though there has been a freeze since 2012, certain subject teachers (English, Maths and Science), were later allowed to be hired. Also, for minority schools the freeze was not completely applicable,\" he said. But he did accept that there has been a separate proven instance of improper hiring. \"The education commissioner had identified around 100-odd teacher appointments that were invalid and the local education officer in turn cancelled all of them.

Some bullion traders claim that investors are more likely to invest in stock markets than in gold and therefore, the jewellery has higher demand than coins and bars. According to a rough estimate, 70% purchases are that of jewellery while 30% is that of coins and bars. The demand for silver is also significant. \"Silverware and artefacts apart from coins etched with religious symbols are in good demand and those who are firm believers of investing in a precious metal on Dhanteras will at least buy a 5-10 gram silver coin,\" said Nanalal Soni, Ahmedabad Gold-Silver Jewellers Association.

The film has been made on the background of Varanasi. \"The film has twin objectives -the first is to stir the medical world to evolve a treatment of MND to save dying patients, and the second is to exhort the citizens of Varanasi to save their dying city,\" said the film director Narendra Acharya adding that here the term \"dying city\" is used symbolically for the city facing lots of illnesses like pathetic condition of civic amenities and polluted environment. \"MND describes a group of diseases that affect the nerves (motor neurons) in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do. With MND, messages from these nerves gradually stop reaching the muscles, leading them to weaken, stiffen and waste,\" said Mishra adding that some people also experience changes to their thinking and behaviour. However, MND affects everyone differently. Not all symptoms will affect everyone, or in the same order. Symptoms also progress at varying speeds, which makes the course of the disease difficult to predict. According to him, MND is life-shortening and there is no cure. Though the disease will progress, symptoms can be managed to help achieve the best possible quality of life. MND cannot be stopped or reversed, but therapies, equipment and medication can help manage symptoms. It is still not possible to give a clear answer about the causes of MND, as different things may trigger the disease for each individual. \"MND can be of more than 30 types, and not all are dangerous and life threatening. Out of these, a variety of MND, that is ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) involves the gradual neuronal death in spinal cord anterior horn cells and patient often present as repeated twitching in the involved group of Neuron and the respective muscle divers (known as muscle unit). Twitching can be in shoulder muscle, tongue, calf. Once the disease progresses it involves the muscle of swallowing and muscles of breathing which causes there life,\" he said adding that patients often die due to choking in wind pipe or aspirations pneumonia both due to pharyngeal involvement. \"No treatment for MND till 2017. In March 2017 Tab Spiranza (Neusersein) have been discovered by an Indian Scientist at USA which is USFDA approved for type of MND that is SMA (spinal muscular atrophy),\" he added. \"In BHU, we have 550 MND patients registered with Neurology department out of them, 170 are ALS who all are in various stage of death,\" he said. According to him, a clinical study about the pattern of MND in eastern India was carried out from July 1993 to June 1995 at Bangur Institute of Neurology, Calcutta and SSKM Hospital, Calcutta. He said that in 2014 the Ice Bucket Challenge was seen in which an activity involving the dumping of a bucket of ice and water over a persons head, either by another person or self-administered, to promote awareness of the MND. It had gone viral on social media during July-August 2014. \"Through this film we also endeavor to bring an awareness among the doctors, policy makers as well as masses to take up the challenge on priority,\" said Mishra.','CITY-VARANASI','Binay Singh','2017-12-10 18:04:00','| TNN | Dec 10, 2017, 18:04 IST','2017-12-16 19:16:40'),(266,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/teenage-girl-found-murdered-in-jaunpur-district/articleshow/62082510.cms','Teenage girl found murdered in Jaunpur district','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62082508,width-400,resizemode-4/62082508.jpg]','VARANASI: A 16-year-old girl, who went missing from her house on Thursday evening, was found murdered in the nearby village in Jaunpur district on Friday.

Moscow suspended flights to Egypt after an Islamic State bomb brought down a Russian airliner over Sinai in October 2015, killing all 224 people on board. The attack decimated Egypts vital tourism industry. Egyptian authorities have since spent millions of dollars to upgrade security at its airports, hoping to get Moscow to change its mind. In comments on Russian state television, Transportation Minister Maxim Sokolov said on Friday that Egypt and Russia have yet to sign a security protocol but that direct flights should resume in early February. Russia, however, is not yet talking about resuming charter flights to Egyptian resorts on the Red Sea, once a popular destination for Russian tourists, Sokolov said, adding that this would be \"the next stage\" of negotiations. President Vladimir Putin on a visit to Cairo on Monday said the deal on the resumption of flights could be signed \"in the nearest time\" and praised Egypts efforts to boost security at its airports. In the wake of the IS bombing, Britain, another major source of visitors to Egypt, suspended flights to Sharm el-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort in Sinai from which the doomed Russian airliner took off. Putins visit to Egypt was part of the Russian presidents blitz day-trip to the region that kicked off with a visit to a Russian air base in Syria, then to Cairo and concluded with a stop in Turkey. It was his second visit to Egypt in as many years, and Putin and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi appeared keen to cement their countries ties, which have deepened in recent years as Moscow has expanded its reach across the region. El-Sissi, who has visited Russia twice since taking office in 2014, has signed deals to buy billions of dollars worth of Russian weapons, including fighter jets and assault helicopters. Last month, Russia approved a draft agreement with Egypt to allow Russian warplanes to use Egyptian military bases. On Thursday, Egyptian Aviation Minister Sherif Fathi headed to Moscow to meet with his Russian counterpart to finalize the agreement on the resumption of flights.','WORLD-EUROPE','','2017-12-15 21:03:00','AP | Dec 15, 2017, 21:03 IST','2017-12-16 19:16:58'),(286,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/explosion-at-major-austrian-gas-hub-one-dead/articleshow/62036661.cms','Explosion at major Austrian gas hub, one dead','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62036789,width-400,resizemode-4/62036789.jpg]','VIENNA: An explosion rocked one of Europes biggest gas pipeline hubs in Austria today, leaving one person dead and 18 injured, emergency services said.

The countrys prime minister during the last two years, Beata Szydlo, was sworn in as deputy prime minister during the ceremony at the Presidential Palace. There had been speculation in Poland on Monday that the Cabinet might undergo immediate changes. That proved not to be the case as the other ministers took their oaths one-by-one and signed declarations pledging to observe the Constitution. Morawiecki, who previously held the posts of deputy prime minister and minister of finance and development, was picked last week to head the government by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the powerful leader of the ruling Law and Justice party. Kaczynski attended the swearing-in ceremony. Szydlo was popular among Poles, but the countrys image abroad has suffered as a result of the conservative governments refusal to accept migrants, pursuit of logging in a virgin forest and more assertive stance toward Germany. Perhaps the most critical point of controversy has been the way Law and Justice has consolidated the governments control over the judiciary, something the European Union sees as a violation of the rule of law. Explaining the switch in leadership, party officials said the government needs to focus on the economy, which has grown in recent years but is seen as in need of a push for innovation and to improve Polands standing in the European Union and with other foreign nations. Morawiecki, a former banker who speaks English and German, is seen as better prepared to represent Poland internationally. He is set to make his first policy speech on Tuesday to Polands parliament and will face a confidence vote from lawmakers. The ruling party has a majority in parliament, so his approval as prime minister is all but certain. Morawiecki suggested earlier there would be some changes to the Cabinet in January.','WORLD-EUROPE','','2017-12-11 23:30:00','AP | Updated: Dec 11, 2017, 23:30 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:00'),(289,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/france-seeks-ways-to-boost-anti-jihadi-force-in-africa/articleshow/62052228.cms','France seeks ways to boost anti-jihadi force in Africa','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62052781,width-400,resizemode-4/62052781.jpg]','PARIS: Presidents, princes and diplomats are coming to Paris on Wednesday to breathe life into a young African military force that aims to counter the growing jihadi threat in the Sahel region.

The pre-dawn operation comes amid simmering tensions between Spains central government and Catalonia over the wealthy regions independence drive, with separatists saying it amounted to \"plundering\". Police cordoned off the museum as workers arrived to remove the disputed art works, including three 15th century wooden caskets. Several hundred people gathered outside the museum chanted \"Hands up! This is a robbery\", images broadcast on Spanish television showed. Some demonstrators briefly scuffled with police as officers tried to move them on. Catalonias regional government bought the art in 1983 from the nuns of the Sijena monastery in neighbouring Aragon. But the regional government of Aragon has since fought to recover the works, arguing they were unlawfully sold, and a court had given the Catalan museum until Monday to hand them over. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoys conservative government dismissed Catalonias government and suspended the regions autonomy after the Catalan parliament on October 27 declared independence. \"It is best to respect court decisions,\" Rajoy said when asked about the operation to remove the art. But Catalonias ousted leader, Carles Puigdemont, took to Twitter to accuse the Spanish government of \"taking advantage of a coup detat to plunder Catalonia with total impunity.\" Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium after the Catalan parliament declared independence, is running for office in an early election in Catalonia on December 21 which was called by Spains central government. He is wanted in Spain for the crimes of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds over his governments independence drive.','WORLD-EUROPE','','2017-12-11 22:04:00','AFP | Dec 11, 2017, 22:04 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:01'),(291,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putins-ex-minister-gets-8-years-over-2-million-bribe/articleshow/62084992.cms','Putins ex-minister gets 8 years over $2 million bribe','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62085122,width-400,resizemode-4/62085122.jpg]','MOSCOW: A Russian court on Friday sentenced former economy minister Alexei Ulyukayev to eight years in a penal colony for taking a $2 million bribe from an ally of President Vladimir Putin. Ulyukayev is the highest-ranking official arrested in Putins 17 years in power. The Moscow court ruled he must also pay a fine of 130 million roubles ($2.2 million) for taking the bribe from Igor Sechin, head of the state oil giant Rosneft, in a sting operation. Judge Larisa Semyonova said the eight years would be served in a \"harsh regime\" colony in a sentence which was slightly below the 10 years demanded by prosecutors. Ulyukayev said the sentence was \"unjust\" and vowed to appeal. Before the ruling he made an effort to appear upbeat with reporters, saying he was expecting a fair hearing and gesturing only to a briefcase of documents when asked if he had brought any belongings with him. Earlier he said a long sentence in a harsh-regime colony, most of which are in remote locations and offer prisoners little contact with families, would effectively be a death sentence. Ulyukayev, who became economic development minister in 2013, was arrested at Rosnefts headquarters last year after being handed a bag containing $2 million by Sechin, who had asked security forces to set up a sting. Sechin told investigators that Ulyukayev had demanded the bribe in return for backing a controversial deal in which Rosneft acquired a stake in Bashneft, another state-run oil group. Ulyukayev had originally opposed the sale of the stake to Rosneft but later endorsed it after Putin said it would help fill state coffers. Ulyukayev denied the charge, saying that he believed the bag contained expensive wines that Sechin had promised him to celebrate the deal. The prosecution did not provide any proof that Ulyukayev opened the bag of marked notes and therefore knew he was receiving a bribe. Sechin has failed to attend court hearings despite being summoned as a witness. Ulyukayev has lost a striking amount of weight while under house arrest and has calmly read books by Chekhov and Kafka, as well as Platos Apology of Socrates, during the trial. In his closing speech last week, he asked forgiveness from Russians for ignoring the injustices of the countrys political system while in power and focusing on building his network and advancing his career. \"When everything is good, you shamefully turn away from peoples grief. Forgive me for that, people,\" Ulyukayev told the court, wiping his forehead with a handkerchief.','WORLD-EUROPE','','2017-12-15 17:56:00','AFP | Dec 15, 2017, 17:56 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:02'),(292,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/new-polish-pm-debuts-at-summit-seeks-better-ties-with-eu/articleshow/62071858.cms','New Polish PM debuts at summit, seeks better ties with EU','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62071979,width-400,resizemode-4/62071979.jpg]','BRUSSELS: Polands new prime minister was making his debut on Thursday at a European Union summit, a first test of whether the Western-educated former banker can bridge a deepening rift between his right-wing government and Brussels. Mateusz Morawiecki, 49, was tapped last week by the leader of the ruling Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, to replace Beata Szydlo. Her two years as prime minister were marked by bitter conflicts with the EU over migrants, the environment and the state of Polands democracy. Polands current isolation marks a sharp reversal for a country that has seen massive economic development since joining the EU in 2004, which brought it an infusion of EU subsidies and foreign investment and which until 2015 was an increasingly influential voice in European affairs. That growing clout was reflected in the election in 2014 of the Polish prime minister at the time, Donald Tusk, to lead the European Council. Tusk leads the two-day EU summit that begins Thursday where leaders are to focus on Brexit, migration and defense. While Kaczynski has not explained his reasons for switching prime ministers, party members have suggested one aim was to improve the countrys international standing. As a communicator, Morawiecki certainly seems better fitted to the task. He is fluent in English and German, studied at universities in the United States and Germany, and for several years headed the Polish branch of a Spanish bank, Santander experiences that give him a more cosmopolitan air than many in his conservative party. Speaking to reporters, Morawiecki appeared conciliatory on Polands extensive logging in the protected Bialowieza forest, a point of contention between Warsaw and EU officials. He said that if the EU court rules that the logging must stop, it will. But he also made clear he was sticking to his predecessors staunch refusal to accept any refugees as part of an EU resettlement plan. \"I am glad that our approach on refugees is becoming more and more understood in the European Union, Morawiecki said, following a statement by Tusk earlier this week that the EUs mandatary refugee quota system has been divisive and ineffective. He said his government supports an earlier policy of giving aid to refugees who stay closer to their homes. \"We want to help people affected by the war on the spot, he said to reporters in Brussels. \"This support is more effective. Yet recent developments in Warsaw will make it hard for Morawiecki to persuade his European counterparts to drop their concerns over the rule of law in Poland. In a case that US State Department says raises concerns about media freedom, Polands media regulator on Monday fined a private news channel nearly 1.5 million zlotys ($420,000) for what it alleged was unfair reporting during a political crisis last year. The channel, TVN24, is the countrys key source of independent television news. Lawmakers last week also passed two new laws regulating the Supreme Court and the National Council of the Judiciary, a body that appoints judges, giving the ruling party control over both institutions. At the Supreme Court, the retirement age for judges was lowered from 70 to 65, which will force the immediate retirement of some 40 per cent of more than 80 judges allowing the president, a party ally, to name their replacements. Law and Justice says it is seeking to purge the justice system of old communist holdovers and corrupt judges out of touch with regular people. Europes top human rights body, the Council of Europe, disagrees, and said aspects of the laws bear similarities to the Soviet judicial system. Morawiecki says he fully backs the changes. A former anti-communist dissident, he said recently some judges still working had passed judgments on his fellow activists in the 1980s. In Brussels, he said, \"Europe should be a Europe of sovereign states who should have the right to reform their justice systems.','WORLD-EUROPE','','2017-12-14 20:08:00','AP | Dec 14, 2017, 20:08 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:02'),(293,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/EU-agrees-to-catch-more-fish-sustainably-in-2018/articleshow/62053545.cms','EU agrees to catch more fish sustainably in 2018','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62053587,width-400,resizemode-4/62053587.jpg]','BRUSSELS: European Union nations have agreed to set quota levels that ensure more sustainable fishing in the Northeastern Atlantic and the North Sea, but environmentalists insist the bloc is behind in its schedule to end over fishing by 2020.

In the past few months, at times wearing his desert military uniform, Shoigu has held talks with Syrias president in Damascus, met Israels prime minister in Jerusalem and been received by the Emir of Qatar in Doha. The defence ministrys forays into areas long regarded as the preserve of the foreign ministry are raising eyebrows in Russia, where strict protocol means ministers usually hold talks only with their direct foreign counterparts. The military is reaping political dividends from what the Kremlin saw as its big successes in Crimea, annexed from Ukraine after Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms seized control of the peninsula in 2014, and Syria, where Russian forces helped turn the tide of war in President Bashar al-Assads favour. \"That has translated into more top-table influence,\" said a long-serving Russian official who interacts with the defence ministry but declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media. The Kremlin and the defence and foreign ministries did not respond to detailed requests for comment for this article, but three sources who know both ministries well confirmed the trend. The growth of the militarys influence has caused discontent among some Russian diplomats and unease among Western officials about the harder edge it is giving Russias foreign policy. Foreign policy-making has become more bellicose and more opaque, and this makes new Russian military adventures more likely, some Western officials say. \"If you allow the defence ministry a bigger say in foreign policy its going to be looking for trouble,\" said one, who declined to be named because of the subjects sensitivity. Shoigus high profile has also revived talk of the long-time Putin loyalist as a possible presidential stand-in if Putin, who is seeking a fourth term in an election in March, had to step down suddenly and was unable to serve out a full six-year term. Shoigu, 62, is not involved in party politics but opinion polls often put him among the top five most popular presidential possibles. His trust rating is also often second only to Putin, with whom he was pictured on a fishing trip this summer. SYRIA ROLE The militarys influence has ebbed and flowed in Russia and, before that, the Soviet Union. It had huge clout at the end of World War Two and in the 1950s after the death of Soviet leader Josef Stalin when Georgy Zhukov, a commander credited with a crucial role in defeating Nazi Germany, was defence minister. But the ignominious Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, completed in 1989, two wars Russia fought in Chechnya after the Soviet Unions collapse, and the sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine with the loss of all 118 people on board in 2000 left the militarys prestige in tatters. Under Putin, a former KGB agent who as president is the armed forces commander-in-chief, its stock has risen. Defence spending has soared, the military has been deployed in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria and its actions are used to foster patriotism. The militarys growing political and foreign policy muscle is most noticeable when it comes to Syria. After going to Damascus twice earlier this year for talks with Assad, Shoigu was at Putins side this week when the president flew in to meet the Syrian leader. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has not visited Syria at all in 2017. Unusually for a defence minister, Shoigu has been involved in diplomatic efforts to bring peace to Syria. In this role he has spoken about the importance of a new draft constitution for the country, met the U.N. special envoy on Syria and had talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. A Western official who has direct contact with the foreign and defence ministries said the Russian military had real heft in Damascus of a kind the foreign ministry did not. There was \"strong mutual trust\" between the Russian military and senior people in Damascus, the official said, because \"the Russians saved their asses and the Syrians respect that.\" The foreign ministry retains strong Middle East experts and continues to play an important Syria role, helping run peace talks taking place in Kazakhstan. But Lavrovs own efforts to secure a US-Russia deal on cooperating in Syria have shown how differently the foreign and defence ministries sometimes think. Lavrov is still seen as a formidable diplomat whom Putin trusts and respects. But Western officials say he is not summoned to all important meetings and is not informed about major military operations in Syria. Policy interventions The militarys other foreign policy interventions include a role in Russias alleged interference in last years US presidential election, US intelligence agencies say. They say the GRU, Russias military foreign intelligence agency, hacked email accounts belonging to Democratic Party officials and politicians, and organised their leaking to the media to try to sway public opinion against Hillary Clinton, Donald Trumps main rival. The Kremlin denies the allegations. Other policy interventions included a news briefing in December 2015 at which the defence ministry said it had proof that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and his family were benefiting from illegal smuggling of oil from Islamic State-held territory in Syria and Iraq. Erdogan said the allegations, made at a briefing held a week after a Turkish air force jet shot down a Russian warplane near the Syrian-Turkish border, amounted to slander. The defence ministrys response to the incident was much sharper than that of Russian diplomats, part of a wide-ranging communications policy that has included frequent criticism of the US State Department and Washingtons foreign policy. Other areas of interest for the defence ministry have included Egypt, Sudan and Libya. Shoigu was involved in talks between Putin and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in Moscow last month and the ministry hosted Khalifa Haftar, Eastern Libyas dominant military figure, aboard its sole aircraft carrier in January. During the visit, Haftar spoke to Shoigu via video link about fighting terrorism in the Middle East. One Western official told Reuters such incidents were fuelling fears that Russia plans to expand its footprint beyond Syria, where it has an air base and a naval facility, to centres such as Yemen, Sudan or Afghanistan. The militarys influence in domestic policy-making has expanded too, Russian analysts and Western officials say, with Putin seeking its views on everything from the digital economy to food security. That is in part because Putin, since the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, has altered the way he takes decisions and widened the scope of what the Security Council, which he chairs, discusses to include many domestic policy questions. \"At a time when theres a feeling that Russia is increasingly surrounded by enemies, Putin is consulting the intelligence services and the military more when he takes all decisions. Hes meeting them all the time,\" said Tatyana Stanovaya, head of the analytical department at the Center for Political Technologies think tank. Stanovaya said that did not mean the military was initiating ideas, but that its opinions were taken into account far more by Putin now than in the past and that it now had an important voice on domestic policy areas.','WORLD-EUROPE','','2017-12-14 09:44:00','Reuters | Dec 14, 2017, 09:44 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:04'),(295,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-shuts-its-embassy-in-yemen-evacuates-diplomats/articleshow/62041542.cms','Russia shuts its embassy in Yemen, evacuates diplomats','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62041559,width-400,resizemode-4/62041559.jpg]','MOSCOW: Russia said it has temporarily shut its embassy in Yemen and evacuated all of its diplomats.

The suicide bomber blew up his explosives-laden car near Inspector General of Police Ehsan Mehboobs office in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, killing at least 13 people, including seven policemen, and wounding 21 others. The blast was claimed by both the local affiliate of the Islamic State terror group and by Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter group of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. Thirteen people, including seven policemen, died in the suicide car bombing, officials said. Hours later, two back-to-back blasts tore through a market crowded with the people shopping for Eid in the Shia- dominated Parachinar city in the Kurram tribal region, killing at least 45 people, mostly Shias, and injuring 75 others. The first blast occurred during rush hour in Turi Market, where a bus terminal is also located. The second blast took place as rescuers and bystanders rushed to aid those who had been hurt in the first explosion. At least 45 people have been killed and 75 others injured in Parachinar, an official from the Parachinar administration told PTI. Earlier, Medical Superintendent of the District General Hospital, Parachinar, Sabir Hussain, confirmed the death of at least 25 people and injuries to over 100 in the blasts. More than 20 of the injured were in critical condition. No group claimed responsibility for the blasts. However, Sunni militant groups have claimed responsibility for several attacks in the area in the past. In the evening, two armed men on a motorcycle, with their faces covered with helmets, opened fire on police officers at a roadside restaurant in Karachi and killed four of them. An assistant sub-inspector was among those killed in the attack, said Superintendent of Police Asif Ahmad. In Parachinar, officials said the blasts on the last Friday of the holy month of Ramazan targeted people shopping in the area and those heading out of the city ahead of Eid. The emergency and rescue services shifted injured to Agency Headquarters hospital Parachinar. The security forces cordoned off the entire area and started search operation. Pakistan Army contingents and FC personnel reached the site of the attack to aid in rescue efforts. \"Two Army aviation helicopters have taken off from Peshawar to Parachinar for the speedy evacuation of the injured to Peshawar,\" the army said in a statement. \"Rescue operation in progress,\" it added. Pakistan army, meanwhile, launched a countrywide intelligence-led military operation against militants. Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor said that security has been tightened across the country. \"Special Intelligence-Based Operation (IBOs) and search operations (were) launched in coordination with intelligence and other Law Enforcement Agencies,\" he said. On March 31, a car bomb blast near an Imambargah of Shia Muslims killed 23 people and injured 70 others in Parachinar. In January, 25 people were killed and 87 others when a bomb tore through a crowded vegetable market in the same city. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attacks, saying that terrorists involved in the attacks will be taken to task and all out efforts will be taken to eliminate terrorism. President Mamnoon Hussain, Senate Chairman Raza Rabbani, Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Governor Balochistan Muhammad Khan Achakzai and former president Asif Ali Zardari, among others, also condemned the attack. Balochistan government spokesperson Anwarul Haq Kakar told Geo News that the suspected Quetta bomber tried to break a security perimetre to target the police offices but blew up after policemen standing guard attempted to stop him. Of the injured, nine are said to be policemen. Kakar blamed India for the Quetta blast. DIG Quetta Abdul Razzaq Cheema, addressing the media, said they are examining CCTV footage to determine the details of the incident. Officials said body parts of the suspected bomber, strewn across the site of the blast, were being collected along with other evidence for forensic examination. An initial investigation report by Civil Defence Director Aslam Tareen revealed that 75 kilogrammes of explosives were used in the Quetta blast. Footage of the incident showed two vehicles badly damaged in the explosion, while debris lay scattered on the street. Officials said the explosion was loud enough to be heard from a distance and shattered windows of nearby buildings. Earlier this year, on February 13, a blast took place near the Saryab Bridge in Quetta killing two personnel of the bomb disposal squad and leaving 11 injured. Later in March, an explosion targeting a security forces convoy occurred on Saryab Road. Four people were injured including three Frontier Corps personnel and a passer-by. In August, last year, a suicide bomber targeted the emergency services ward at Civil Hospital, following the death of the president of the Balochistan High Court Bar Association, killing at least 70 people and leaving many wounded.','WORLD-PAKISTAN','','2017-06-24 09:04:00','PTI | Updated: Jun 24, 2017, 09:04 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:05'),(297,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-asks-india-to-suspend-work-on-kishanganga-ratle-hydro-power-projects-in-jammu-and-kashmir/articleshow/56700715.cms','Pakistan asks India to suspend work on Kishanganga, Ratle hydro power projects in Jammu and Kashmir','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-56700715,width-400,resizemode-4/56700715.jpg]','ISLAMABAD: Pakistans two parliamentary committees in a joint resolution asked India to immediately suspend the ongoing construction of the Kishanganga and Ratle hydro power projects+ in Jammu and Kashmir, Dawn reported. The two projects are being constructed on the Jhelum and Chenab rivers. A resolution adopted by the National Assemblys foreign affairs and water and power committees also asked the World Bank to set up a Court of Arbitration to mediate the dispute over the Indus Waters Treaty between the two countries. It said that under the Indus Waters Treaty+ (IWT), it is the responsibility of the World Bank to play its role without further delay. Until the World Bank constitutes the court of arbitration, it must persuade India to put an immediate halt to ongoing construction of the Ratle dam till the issue is resolved, read the joint resolution adopted unanimously by both the government and opposition members of the committees. The construction of dams on the western rivers by India has brought the two countries at loggerheads and Pakistan has engaged the World Bank, a facilitator of the IWT, to stop India from going ahead with the construction. The committees were briefed on the agenda -- Indian threat on the Indus Waters Treaty and to chart out a course of action for Pakistan. The meeting was co-chaired by Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari and Muhammad Arshad Khan Leghari, members of the parliament and the chairmen of the two committees. Briefing the committees, Foreign Secretary Aizaz Chaudhry said all options were available with Pakistan in case India violated the IWT. \"We will not let India violate the treaty,\" Chaudhry said, adding that Pakistan had already engaged the World Bank to look into the issue as guarantor. \"We have already requested the World Bank to appoint chairman of the arbitration court,\" he said. The secretary said Islamabad would defend its right at any cost. New Delhi, he alleged, was using delaying tactics while \"we want to resolve the issue at the earliest\". Pakistan has serious reservations over an Indian move to construct 45 to 60 dams on the western rivers, he said. Water and Power Secretary Younus Dagha said Pakistan was challenging the construction of Kishanganga and Ratle projects in the court of international arbitration. He, however, said India had not as yet started work on Ratle project.

A boss who doesnt know who is doing what, where, why, when or how, a boss who doesnt keep track and ignores performance problems. A boss who doesnt tell them what to do and how to do it and who doesnt spell out expectations but leaves them to their own devices. These employees collect their pay packets just as everyone else, regardless of their mediocre performance . In other words, they are the beneficiaries of undermanagement. And therein lies the importance of appraisals . They help to strategically review the strength, weaknesses and achievements of workers during the year, says Bruce Tulhan, author of \"Its okay to Manage Your Boss\". The title is catchy, its specific, detailed and honest. Tulhans warning that becoming a better manager is like starting a fitness programme couldnt have been more apt. The book advises you on how to engage your boss in your work, get clear directions from him and guides employees with tools and feedback for success. But he also says clearly that the book is meant for high-performers. He says that one needs to create a close, official relationship with every boss, no matter how great or awful he is, no matter how he is on any given day or how he himself performs. Tulhan charts out four basic things an employee must take responsibility for. They are: Clearly spelled-out and reasonable expectations with a concrete timetable; skills, tools and resources necessary to meet those expectations; accurate feedback about your performance as well as coursecorrecting direction and fair quid pro quo, ie, recognition and rewards in exchange for performance. There are also tips for keeping a close, official relationship with your coworkers. Tulhan is also able to shift the wheat from the chaff and says that though managers are demanding more and more from employees, they are also providing them with less guidance than ever before. But employees can improve their careers despite this lacunae. He debunks certain myths such as if you are a high-performer , then your boss shouldnt tell you how to do your work. This book is especially relevant in todays times when companies are cutting back on overhead expenses and staff as they ride out the financial crisis. Many of todays employees are overworked, often performing the job of two or three people for no additional pay. Research shows that many employees feel powerless and are not in a position to complain about their circumstances, holding on to the job the way one would cling to a lifeboat. It also talks about the epidemic of undermanagement, which is responsible for the precarious environment at the workplace. It is a well-researched book and a successful follow-up to Tulhans earlier book \"It is Okay to be Boss . And the bottomline is: It is okay to manage your boss if you are good.','HAVING-JOB-BLUES-ENGAGE-YOUR-BOSS','Arun Sharma','2011-07-10 07:01:00','| TNN | Updated: Jul 10, 2011, 07:01 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:06'),(300,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/enjoy-the-sight-of-the-illuminated-palace-till10-pm/articleshow/60478067.cms','Enjoy the sight of the illuminated palace till 10 pm','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.comhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-58127550/toilogo.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.comhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-58127550/toilogo.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.comhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-58127550/toilogo.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.comhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-58127550/toilogo.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-60478067,width-400,resizemode-4/60478067.jpg]','Watching the Mysore Palace in its full glory when it is illuminated at night is a popular pasttime for visitors visitors to the city.

And yet, human beings continue to live and love and strive for some semblance of a decent world. It is this striving that runs through Mohsin Hamid s new novel, Exit West. The Lahore-based writer spoke to Namita Devidayal about how we are living in an apartheid planet where passports have become the new markers of caste. But he is optimistic that this dangerous trend cannot be sustained This is an important book for our times. Do you think a writer has an obligation to document such moments in history? I dont necessarily believe writers have an obligation. But this particular writer feels very engaged with the world around and with these issues. Someone like me who has migrated so many times in life — to California as a child and back to Pakistan, then America to study and Britain and back to Pakistan — shouldnt exist if migration is prohibited. In terms of wanting to address this, I think one of the powers that storytelling has is to expand our sense of empathy towards people who are different from us, and to explore futures. You have talked in the past about the difference between migration and immigration, where one is a natural flow and the other involves border controls and force. You seem to long for a world without borders. Please elaborate. I think that in a couple of centuries people will look back at this moment in history and think that it is strange and primitive to discriminate against people on the basis of the country they happen to be born in, just as we think it is strange to discriminate against people on the basis of their race, colour and ethnicity, how they express themselves or whom they love. How can we say that everyone is equal but they have fundamentally different rights to move and travel? To me, thats unsustainable. It will take time to get there, but eventually the movement towards human beings being equal is going to triumph. Of course, the fear of migrants is natural, we shouldnt diminish it, but these are fears we have to combat. What can we do to reverse this dangerous new trend? We have to remember that this obsession with controlling borders is a very temporary moment in human history. Until the First World War, people used to travel all over the place without passports and visas. People move. They always have, and they are likely to continue. If we pretend that human beings are not going to move, we are going to turn our countries into prisons and police states that will eventually collapse. So my suggestion is that we create an environment of openness, even if very slowly. You could have lived anywhere in the world, but you chose to come back to Lahore. Given how dangerous it has been, do you still feel you made the right decision? When people read about Lahore they think its dangerous but actually Lahore is quite a bit safer than, say, Delhi. My friends in Delhi are much more afraid about crime than my friends in Lahore. In Lahore, dozens of people are killed due to terrorists every year. But in big cities in South Asia, hundreds or even thousands are murdered due to violent crimes. So Lahore might be dangerous compared to Geneva, but we dont live in Geneva, we live in South Asia. A life that attempts to minimise all risk is a meaningless life. Its a life without any interaction, without any engagement, and a repression of the human instinct. The people I love are in Lahore and I accept a certain amount of risk to be around them. How do you feel being a Muslim in the world today? I cant answer that question. For me its an impossible request because it involves separating out different parts of ones identity. How do you feel being a man in the world today? How do you feel having brown skin? How do you feel writing fiction today? How do you feel being a father? Or someone who loves sushi? Or someone who eats mostly vegetables? Ones identity is a very complex and multi-faceted thing and I feel differently in different places and different contexts. So I am very resistant to privileging one aspect of my identity. I am also very resistant to representing. I am just an observer and a storyteller and a human being and in that respect I feel anxious in the world today, but I also recognise that one has to resist that anxiety and articulate a kind of radical optimism. In my own way I am trying to begin to do that.','HOME-SELF-GOALS-A-BIGGER-THREAT-TO-BJP-THAN-OPPONENT-RAHUL','','2017-03-19 02:00:00','Mar 19, 2017, 02:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:11'),(304,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/self-goals-a-bigger-threat-to-bjp-than-opponent-rahul/all-that-matters/cities-must-plan-for-an-india-on-the-move-or-end-up-as-slums/articleshow/59302042.cms','Cities must plan for an India on the move or end up as slums','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59302101,width-400,resizemode-4/59302101.jpg]','By Gautam Bhatia Cities as permanent and static may be a Western fact, but it is an Indian myth. After 20 years in India, I went back to Philadelphia where I had been a student. Despite the long break, I was able to move about familiar buildings and landmarks as if I had just left yesterday. I return to Delhi after a month away, and the change is noticeable and disorienting. Buildings have stained, broken, changed ownership, added floors, been demolished. The park has acquired a temple, families are camped on the road. There are more people everywhere. Demographic changes to the city are far more caustic and lethal than those that meet the eye. In Mumbai, 2,400 migrant families move in every week; while Delhi gets its share with a two lakh intake every year. If the crowding is more visible in Mumbai it is only because Delhis 1,500 square kilometres spreads the increase over a wider footprint. In cities like Visakhapatnam, Kanpur and Jabalpur more than half the residents live in large slums or as migrants waiting to make their own slums. More enter every city every day. Three rules of entropy apply to all Indian cities. First, every planning model is overturned by an excess of population — housing and public transport, for example, cannot keep up with rising numbers. Second, space is often not legally used for the intention for which it is made — markets become warehouses, houses are used as makeshift factories, sidewalks as temporary homes, parks as toilets. Third, everything decays and falls apart faster than the Mughal monument down the road — an indicator as much of weathering, as of poor construction quality. These unwritten rules make every act of construction redundant before its time. My own planned colony in Delhi is next to one of the citys largest slums. Mud shacks, half brick, are clustered in densities so tight it is humanly impossible to negotiate the alleys within. Still, every day sewing machines work away, a small shop dispenses essentials, children play cricket on a pitch condensed to slum size. Life is open, participatory, and with a host of spontaneous relationships. My colony, by contrast, is better known for its shortcomings: private cars clog public roads, garbage spills out of municipal bins, there are daily battles over parking, shuttered gates, an occasional murder. Life is private, insular and getting more so. That the two places are urban neighbours is not unusual. Even though the primary thrust of both places is an improvement of life, there is a clear difference between intent and result. In one, a great density of people live in relative harmony, their houses, utilities, public facilities on constant upgrade; in the other, life is in perennial decline, people are self-protective, possessive and ready to shoot each other over a parking spot, there is continual overbuilding and crowding. After a few years, my supposed posh colony will be indistinguishable from the slum; and after a few more, the slum would become the preferred address. Such a reversal is happening all over Delhi, Kanpur, Bengaluru and many other cities with a growing population of dispossessed. With a rapid increase in urban migration, it will continue to happen, till the planned city becomes so minor and insignificant it will be absorbed in a vast single slum. This isnt such a bad thing. More and more, the government needs to recognise these forces as positive. When the citys slum area was a mere 10%, it was possible to whitewash and erase people from civic visibility. But by 2025 India expects to have the largest mobile population in the world. A recognition of the daunting statistics should become a key factor in city design. Even without a conscious plan, the city of the future will emerge out of these migration numbers, and planning will be turned upon its head. No longer will the great symbolic spaces of Delhi or the state capitals hold relevance. For the new majority, the tradition of land ownership, home, civic participation will be drowned in their own reality — a shifting employment and home as temporary camp. Bureaucracy and planning will necessarily have to reorient their aims to migratory tasks. Fluid, constantly transforming cities will become the norm; pushed into a corner the architect and planner will need to figure out possible methods for their new, relentlessly mobile clients. Lacking ideas of its own the government has no choice but to accept the prototype of the Western model. In the long term, the Indian city will become a recognisable original entity only if it gives cohesive structure to migration. If anything, the older, settled, middle-class residents must learn to live with change, if necessary integrate, or move.

The article, which is being widely debated and discussed, argued that the liberal world order sustained on western military alliances and shared values is under severe threat. Post Brussels, shes been arguing against the increasingly loud calls for isolationism in European nations. She tells Malini Nair that far from being alarmist, her analysis is based on a very realistic reading of recent political developments. Youve said that we are two or three bad elections away from the end of the liberal world order, with the possibility of Donald Trumps victory in the US polls, the likelihood of Britains exit from the European Union and Marie Le Pens victory in the 2017 elections in France. It sounds like a doomsday scenario. All the things I said in the article are realistic. Donald Trump as possible Republican nominee and later president is a reality, Britains exit from the European Union after the June referendum could be a reality, and so could Marie Le Pens chances at the polls in France. She has promised to leave both EU and the NATO, and opposes free trade and supports protectionism. I am currently in Amsterdam and it is clear that the Dutch Party for Freedom (a far right party) is leading in all polls on next years election. I didnt invent any of these but all these political situations are leading to my argument. Why is the idea of the West coming to an end bad news for other parts of the world? When I say West, I mean the ideas that underpin it — European borders, for instance. For 60 years, since the end of the last World War, Europe has stuck to its agreement to not wage wars or change borders by force. Then the NATO military alliance is important for international stability, for your part of the world as well. The international trade agreement in 1930 ensures there is no protectionism. These lowered barriers to trade are very important for all including India. If they go up again both India and China will be affected. I mostly write about Europe, but the same arguments apply to Asia. If the US withdraws and becomes more isolationist, then there will be no block on Chinese domination of southeast Asia. The basic premise of your argument is Trumps possible triumph in the November elections. The idea of him as president was a joke once, it is no longer funny or impossible. How did this happen? It is possible that the US Republican Party leadership started promoting ideas that voters arent really excited about. Tax cuts for the rich, for instance. Or the Republican stance on Obamacare. Also, the party rallied around Jeb Bush too early and the idea that it was promoting oligarchy and family offended the people. No one took Trump seriously enough — he was vulgar, violent, a fool. It is hard to see what he stands for because he doesnt stand for anything. He stands for protest against everything; a lot of it is angry rhetoric that just amounts to insults. Some of his ideas are of course near impossible — a wall to mark the boundary between the US and Mexico for instance. But maybe a part of the country is not interested in policies, just protests. Also remember he didnt win a majority in the primaries. He just won 30% of Republican Party votes. It isnt just the US, rightwing politics is on the rise across large parts of Europe and in India as well. To what do you attribute this? There could be different reasons for this. One factor is the nature of media, especially social media. It is now easier for people with extreme points of views to dominate communication. It is also a delayed reaction to globalization. People get the sense that factories in China are affecting their jobs in Bengaluru. Or that they are losing control over their lives. For instance, you are seeing anti-migration views and movements even in countries that are not facing mass immigration and the problems related to it, like Slovakia and Poland. I dont claim to be an expert on India, but I do know that there has been a decline in leftwing ideals and the larger movement it was a part of, and of mainstream left-leaning parties like the Congress. In their absence, people look for other parties that promote other kinds of big, different economic ideas.','HOME-SELF-GOALS-A-BIGGER-THREAT-TO-BJP-THAN-OPPONENT-RAHUL','Malini Nair','2016-03-27 00:01:00','| Mar 27, 2016, 00:01 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:12'),(306,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/self-goals-a-bigger-threat-to-bjp-than-opponent-rahul/all-that-matters/ai-can-help-doctors-fight-cancer-but-its-not-meant-to-replace-them/articleshow/59196056.cms','AI can help doctors fight cancer, but it’s not meant to replace them','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59196141,width-400,resizemode-4/59196141.jpg]','From mining medical records and designing treatment plans to developing precision medicines, artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a bigger role in healthcare. Shobita Dhar spoke to Rob Merkel, general manager of oncology and genomics, IBM Watson Health, about how the cognitive computing system is working with clinicians, researchers, businesses and governments worldwide, and in India, to solve healthcare challenges that range from cancer to diabetes. How can AI help the doctor? There is an overwhelming amount of information available to physicians today. In oncology alone, there are more than 160,000 studies published each year. Yet there are few tools to help doctors draw meaning from this knowledge. With training, AI technologies like Watson are assisting physicians to summarise patient records and synthesise the vast body of medical data — from clinical records to medical literature to genomics and even data from wearable devices like the Apple Watch — so that they can deliver personalised, evidence-based treatment options to their patients. Can over-dependence on machines make doctors complacent and lazy? The responsibility for medical decisions ultimately lies with the doctor. Just as physicians have relied on textbooks in the past, a technology like Watson can help doctors make more informed, data-driven decisions, but it is not intended to supersede their expert judgments. Manipal Hospitals in Bengaluru has been using Watson and a recent study showed that the supercomputer suggested the same treatment options as the hospitals oncologists in 96.4% of 362 cancer cases analysed. This is quite a high accuracy. How was this achieved? After winning the TV quiz show Jeopardy! in 2011, Watson began training at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Center in New York, one of the worlds leading cancer institutes. The resulting platform, Watson for Oncology, went through rigorous training and testing with MSK before it was released for any given cancer type. (It is currently available to support breast, lung, colorectal, gastric, ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers.) So its not surprising that these MSK-level opinions frequently matched Manipal Hospitals multi-disciplinary tumour board. How well are oncologists responding and adapting to AI? Watson for Oncology is already in use in 13 countries. Oncologists are sceptical of almost any new technology, but when they experience Watson directly, they are impressed. A University of North Carolina oncologist who used Watson for Genomics has said it can analyse genomic data and surface an accurate list of targeted treatment options in mere seconds — a task that generally requires hours of time from a molecular tumour board. An oncologist from the Mayo clinic shared that the amount of time to screen a patient for clinical trials was reduced from 30 minutes to 8 minutes. What are the limits of AI in medical care and what can go wrong? Doctors should always be at the centre of patient care decisions. AI can go wrong when an underlying assumption is made that it can replace human judgment. Watson is a valuable tool for clinicians — not a replacement for clinicians. We provide insights to oncologists in a very transparent manner so that they can directly access relevant patient information or medical literature which supports these insights. Will technologies like Watson mean a need for fewer doctors and nurses thereby reducing healthcare costs? It is physically impossible for doctors and nurses to read the amount of information to stay current in their profession — there are not enough hours in the day. Watson provides an opportunity to partner with doctors and nurses to assist in analysing this information so that they can spend more time with their patients. It is also our hope that Watson can help doctors and nurses deliver efficient and effective care to their patients during the increasingly short period of time available for patient visits. This is especially important in markets like India where there is only one oncologist for every 1,600 patients.','HOME-SELF-GOALS-A-BIGGER-THREAT-TO-BJP-THAN-OPPONENT-RAHUL','','2017-06-18 13:19:00','Updated: Jun 18, 2017, 13:19 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:13'),(307,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/theresa-may-defeated-in-parliament-over-brexit-blueprint/articleshow/62065587.cms','Theresa May defeated in parliament over Brexit blueprint','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62065588,width-400,resizemode-4/62065588.jpg]','LONDON: Prime Minister Theresa Mays government was defeated on Wednesday, when MPs forced through changes to its Brexit blueprint that ministers said could endanger Britains departure from the European Union.

In focus on Wednesday was an amendment put forward by Conservative lawmaker and former attorney general Dominic Grieve who wants parliament to have a meaningful vote on any deal before it is finalised and for it to be written into law. \"There is a time for everybody to stand up and be counted,\" Grieve told parliament earlier, criticising some fellow members of the Conservative Party for calling him a traitor over his decision to vote against the government. He dismissed a last-minute pledge by justice minister Dominic Raab for government to write the promise of a meaningful vote into law later on its journey through both houses of parliament as coming \"too late\". The government was \"disappointed\" by the vote, a spokeswoman said in a statement, adding that \"this amendment does not prevent us from preparing our statute book for exit day\". But with May due at an EU summit on Thursday to encourage the other 27 leaders to approve a move to the second phase of Brexit talks and begin a discussion about future trade, the defeat comes at a difficult time for the prime minister. In the European Parliament, which must also ratify any withdrawal treaty with Britain, its Brexit coordinator cheekily tweeted that his British counterparts had \"taken back control\" - a reference to the catchphrase of pro-Brexit campaigners. \"A good day for democracy,\" added Guy Verhofstadt. The EU withdrawal bill has been the focus of seven days of often bitter debate, underscoring the deep divisions over Brexit not only among the Conservatives but also in the main opposition Labour Party and across the country. It has also highlighted Mays weakness. In June, she gambled on a snap election to strengthen her partys majority in the 650-seat parliament but instead bungled her campaign and ended up with a minority government propped up by the 10 votes of a small, pro-Brexit Northern Irish party. Since then she has struggled to assert her authority over a Conservative Party which is deeply divided over the best route out of the EU. \"This defeat is a humiliating loss of authority for the government on the eve of the European Council meeting,\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a statement. \"Theresa May has resisted democratic accountability. Her refusal to listen means she will now have to accept Parliament taking back control.\" Earlier, May had tried to persuade MPs to vote with the government for her Brexit blueprint, saying Grieves amendment would put added time pressure on a government which wants to make Britain ready to leave the EU in March 2019. \"That could be at a very late stage in the proceedings which could mean that we are not able to have the orderly and smooth exit from the European Union that we wish to have,\" she told parliament before an hours-long debate on the exit plan. Her spokesman said the government had \"in good faith come forward with a strong package of concessions to deal with the spirit of the amendment\". Pro-Brexit lawmakers fear the amendment could force Britain to weaken its negotiating stance by offering parliament the opportunity of forcing ministers back to the negotiating table if it feels any final deal is not good enough. Raab said that could convince the EU that Britain would not walk away from a bad deal. \"Actually if that looked likely wed end up with worse terms, and wed be positively incentivising the EU to give us worse terms,\" he told parliament.','WORLD-UK','','2017-12-14 12:43:00','Reuters | Dec 14, 2017, 12:43 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:15'),(308,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/babys-heart-placed-back-inside-her-chest-in-rare-surgeries/articleshow/62057900.cms','Babys heart placed back inside her chest in rare surgeries','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62057924,width-400,resizemode-4/62057924.jpg]','LONDON: British officials say a baby born with an extremely rare condition has survived three surgeries to place her heart inside her chest.

The study by UK-based Quilliam group calls for greater government support to help integrate British Pakistani people into modern UK society. \"We began thinking we would debunk the media narrative that Asians are over-represented in this specific crime. But, when the final numbers came in we were alarmed and dismayed. For both of us being of Pakistani heritage, this issue is deeply personal and deeply disturbing,\" said Muna Adil, one of two authors of the report called Group Based Child Sexual Exploitation: Dissecting Grooming Gangs. Quilliam looked at 58 cases of grooming gangs identified in the UK between 2005 and 2017, which led to 264 convictions. They discovered that 222 of those convicted, or 84 per cent, were men of Asian origin and mostly of Pakistani heritage. Only 22 were black and 18 were white with two offenders not having an identified ethnicity. The findings are in stark contrast to the fact that Asians make up only seven per cent of the UK population, the study noted. \"There has been a lot of coverage of grooming gangs recently, ranging from the politically correct, who dont want to talk about it, and the bigots who want to use it for hate. Not talking about it doesnt make the problem go away, and letting bigots hijack the debate creates further division in society. We as a society need to tackle this head on,\" noted Haras Rafiq, chief executive of Quilliam. The study found that while girls from the Asian community were seen as \"protected\" because chastity was linked to \"family honour\", young white women were deemed \"easy targets\" and \"open to sexual relationships with a little persuasion\". They also identified how men in the gangs had shared a common view of their sexual abuse, having collectively justified their behaviour, according to the new study quoted in the UK media. \"The notion that certain cultures are out of bounds when it comes to criticism is not just misguided and misinformed, but often allows the most vulnerable individuals from society to continue to be victimised and abused,\" the report notes. Since 2011, groups of men - mostly of Pakistani origin - have been prosecuted for organised sex-grooming crimes against hundreds of girls across cities of England like Rochdale, Rotherham and Birmingham.','WORLD-UK','','2017-12-10 19:01:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 10, 2017, 19:01 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:20'),(312,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/man-arrested-trying-to-climb-wall-at-uks-buckingham-palace/articleshow/62027607.cms','Man arrested trying to climb wall at UKs Buckingham Palace','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62027917,width-400,resizemode-4/62027917.jpg]','LONDON: British police on Monday said they had arrested a man who tried to climb a wall at Queen Elizabeths Buckingham Palace home in central London, but said that the incident was not terrorism-related.

In May 2016, a man with a conviction for murder climbed over the wall and walked for about 10 minutes around the grounds of the palace before being arrested. He was jailed for four months. Four years ago, a man armed with a knife tried to enter through a gate and was later jailed for 16 months. A month earlier, two men were arrested following a break-in at the palace.

I-T officials said five days into the search operation, their counterparts in Coimbatore were still awaiting clearance from higher-ups in Chennai for searching the rooms used by Sasikala, now under lock and key.

Police constables and officers tried to justify holding up traffic at many places, saying they had to free up routes for VIP convoys.

Almost every top temple in Tamil Nadu has free darshan queue and payment queue, and as of now those in the latter get closer to the deity than their free darshan counterparts.

Money cannot be a basis for creating differentiation among equals as the same was without any reasonable basis and without precedence in law or custom, the petitioner added. Contending that any hindrance in equal access to all devotees irrespective of their caste, gender or financial ability will be against the right to practice religion, he said: \"Religious and charitable institutions were not founded with the motive of earning profit, but for religious and charitable purposes.

A facebook post by AIADMK Rajya Sabha MP, Maitreyan, last week, on monsoon rains impacting the lives of the public in Chennai and suburban regions, highlighted the simmering discontent. \"Even though the ministers and officials are taking the requisite steps, the cadres are being kept in the dark by the party functionaries in the respective areas. Even I am kept in the dark,\" he had stated in his post, highlighting the internal differences in the party. One need to just take a look at the happenings in the AIADMKs IT wing to understand the reality. Even as the opposition DMK is focused on strengthening its IT arm, in the AIADMK, which was the first in Tamil Nadu to jump on to the IT bandwagon, things are in a disarray. Soon after the OPS rebellion in the party, the partys then general secretary V K Sasikala had sacked the IT wing secretary Singai G Ramachandran and replaced him with V V R Raj Sathyan, who was the joint secretary. Post the merger of the EPS and OPS factions, Ramachandran is now back at the helm. Now, the Raj Sathyan team has launched a short film, featuring actress Kasturi, to create awareness about dengue and steps to be taken by the people, on behalf of the partys IT wing. The film will be screened in cinema theatres shortly. The team has also established a support centre, which can be reached by people during emergencies like heavy rain, floods and other natural calamities. Singai Ramachandran, however, says that the latest short film was not done by the partys IT wing. \"It could have been done by someone, since there are several members who have volunteered to be part of the IT wing,\" Ramachandran told TOI. \"On behalf of the IT wing, we had already created a video to create awareness among public. In addition, we have formed volunteer teams to support the needy public during emergencies across the state,\" he pointed out. Raj Sathyan did not wish to go deeper into the internal differences in the party. According to him, the idea is to enhance the communication levels between the government and the people, especially the needy. \"Though the government machinery is taking prompt measures, as could be seen during the recent rains and related havoc, these are not getting portrayed properly,\" feels Sathyan, who continues to lead a team of IT professionals for partys support.','CITY-CHENNAI','D Govardan','2017-11-14 08:48:00','| TNN | Updated: Nov 14, 2017, 08:48 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:27'),(322,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/actors-entering-politics-disastrous-prakash-raj/articleshow/61620506.cms','Actors entering politics disastrous: Prakash Raj','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61621699,width-400,resizemode-4/61621699.jpg]','CHENNAI: It would be disastrous if actors enter politics just because they are popular, said actor and Tamil Film Producers Council vice president Prakash Raj on Sunday.

Although C-sections have been on the rise in the state for several years, public health experts say it has been the steepest over the past decade. The total number of births in the state, meanwhile, has dropped by nearly 14%, from 10,81,965 in 2010 to 9,21,657 in 2016, while the number of institutional deliveries went up by 0.16%, from 99.81% to 99.97%, in the same period -a time coinciding with a marked increase in C-sections. The increase in C-sections, which the state health department has documented in its health management information system, has prompted both a debate and concern among doctors, activists and patient groups. When needed, a C-section can save the mother and child from injury or death, but experts say many surgeries may be needless. One of reasons for the huge increase, for instance, is because of the number of women opting for infertility treatment. \"Nearly 99% of the women who get pregnant after IVF treatment undergo C-sections because doctors and parents dont want to waste the money and time invested,\" said Ramachandra Medical Centre senior consultant Dr N Palaniappan, who also heads the Safe Mother Committee at Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India. \"IVF options are still not available in government hospitals so the cost remains high,\" he said. Besides, there are other complications such as anaemia, obesity, hypertension and diabetes that increase risk of complications during normal delivery. While doctors at a tertiary centre with multidisciplinary care and intensive care units may decide to wait, the option is almost ruled out in smaller towns. Most doctors take an early decision to avoid litigation, said a professor of gynae cology from Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology , Egmore. \"Every maternal death is also audited by the government. No other specialist is under as much observation as an obstetrician,\" she said.\"All maternal deaths are audited and every doctor must answer why there was a maternal or infant death.\" There is no clear guideline on the rate of C-sections. Bodies like the World Health Organisation say that an increase of more than 10% makes no difference to mortality rates. And many experts concur with the state health department view that such surgeries do little to improve the health of mother or child. C-sections also increase at least double the cost in most hospitals. Key Indicators of Morbidity , Utilisation and Health Expenditure Tamil Nadu, a study based on National Sample Survey (NSS), 71st Round (January-June 2014), shows total expenditure on childbirth at private hospitals in Tamil Nadu, at Rs 32,182, is more than 40% of the national average of Rs 18,730. But in government hospitals and PHCs -where 60% of deliveries take place -the cost is much lower than the national average. The state health department, which does C-section indication audits for government hospitals, says it may be tough to do similar audits for private hospitals.\"The decision may be subjective [so it] is very tough to question,\" director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy said.','CITY-CHENNAI','Pushpa Narayan','2017-10-17 09:20:00','| TNN | Oct 17, 2017, 09:20 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:29'),(326,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/sticker-in-biometric-devices-to-help-prevent-infections/articleshow/61111688.cms','Sticker in biometric devices to help prevent infections','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61111702,width-400,resizemode-4/61111702.jpg]','CHENNAI: Biometric identification system, which involves capturing fingerprints, has been a technology on the rise to establish an individuals identity be it for Aadhaar, visa applications or even to mark attendance at offices.But these devices can also be a potential source of germs.Studies show pathogens like staphylococcus aureus and E-Coli easily spread through such contact points.

The technology `Push n Disinfect was launched on Sunday at the India International Science Festival.

An alcohol or water-based sterlising agent is stored in these polymers. Upon using the fingerprint reading device, the user can press on the patch with the same finger.

It is not just these fingerprint reading devices that could be a Petri dish of pathogens. Other objects like door knobs and handles could also be hotspots for infection transfer.

In Jerusalem, a Palestinian stabbed an Israeli security guard, seriously wounding him in the first attack in the volatile city since Trumps pronouncement Wednesday. In Beirut, scores of Lebanese and Palestinian demonstrators clashed with security forces outside the heavily guarded US Embassy, and Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo demanded that the United States rescind the decision. The move upended decades of US policy, and a longstanding international consensus, that the fate of Jerusalem be decided in negotiations. Israeli and Palestinian claims to the citys eastern sector form the emotional core of their conflict, and Trumps announcement was seen as siding with the Israelis and has drawn wide international criticism. At a meeting in Paris with Israels visiting prime minister, French President Emmanuel Macron condemned recent violence against Israelis. But he also expressed \"disapproval\" of Trumps decision, calling it \"dangerous for peace.\" \"It doesnt seem to serve, in the short term, the cause of Israels security and the Israelis themselves,\" Macron said. He urged Israel to freeze its construction of settlements on occupied lands and called for other confidence-building measures toward the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has called Trumps decision \"historic,\" said Israel has maintained its capital in the city for 70 years and the Jewish connection to Jerusalem goes back 3,000 years. \"Paris is the capital of France, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel,\" he said. \"We respect your history and your choices. And we know that as friends, you respect ours.\" \"I think the sooner the Palestinians come to grips with this reality, the sooner we move toward peace,\" he added. The exchange between the two allies set the stage for what could be a tense meeting Monday for Netanyahu with European Union foreign ministers in Brussels. The Jerusalem issue and the moribund peace process are expected to be high on the agenda. Last week, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini warned that Trumps decision \"has the potential to send us backward to even darker times than the one we are already living in.\" She also warned that Trumps \"move could diminish the potential role that the United States could play in the region and create more confusion around this.\" The meeting could be a precursor for what seems to be an emerging rift between Israel and the US on one side, and Europe and the Palestinians on the other. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said Trumps decision has in effect disqualified the US from continuing in its role as the traditional mediator of peace talks. The Palestinians have spent recent days trying to rally Arab and broader international opposition to the decision. After Abbas political adviser Majdi Khaldi said Saturday that the Palestinian leader wont meet with Vice President Mike Pence when he visits the region this month, a spokeswoman for Pence said Sunday it was \"unfortunate that the Palestinian Authority is walking away again from an opportunity to discuss the future of the region.\" EU leaders, including Macron, have reiterated support for establishing an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Trump has said he would support the idea if both sides endorse it _ effectively giving Israel a veto over any peace proposal. Netanyahus government is dominated by opponents to Palestinian independence. Trumps Middle East team, headed by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, has been working for months on a peace plan but has not yet released it. Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed the area to its capital in a move that was not internationally recognized. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip. East Jerusalem is home to Judaisms most sacred site, as well as key holy places for Christians and Muslims. These conflicting claims have erupted into deadly bloodshed in the past. A senior US official appealed to world leaders, especially in the Middle East, to calm regional tensions. Acting Assistant Secretary of State David Satterfield told Arab journalists that Trumps pronouncement was merely a \"recognition of simple reality\" that Israels government already is in Jerusalem. He said the US was not prejudging final-status negotiations about the citys final borders and expressed hope that world leaders understand the US is committed to moving forward with a peace plan he expects to be unveiled in the new year. \"This is a question of choice: Do leaders choose to speak to their peoples, to their regions in terms that reflect reality or in terms that incite or inflame?\" he said. \"We hope its the former.\" The Palestinians staged three \"days of rage\" after Trumps dramatic announcement, with clashes breaking out in flashpoints across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, and Gaza militants firing rockets into Israel. Four people in Gaza were killed. In the West Bank, there were dozens of injuries, but no deaths. There were indications that Sundays stabbing at the Jerusalem bus station was motivated by Trumps move, although police did not officially confirm it. They said the attacker was a 24-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank city of Nablus. Israeli media identified him as Yassin Abu al-Qarah, who posted on his Facebook page in recent days about Jerusalem, saying \"our blood is devoted\" to the holy city. Comments on his profile called him a hero for the alleged attack. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the guard sustained a serious wound to his upper body and the attacker was apprehended. Palestinian youths also clashed in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, hurling stones at Israeli soldiers, who fired back with rubber bullets and tear gas. In Beirut, Lebanese security forces broke up the protest outside the US Embassy after demonstrators pelted them with stones. After a rowdy start, the protest drew several hundred people and became more peaceful, with demonstrators chanting and singing. Clashes resumed in the afternoon, with security forces chasing and arresting a handful of protesters and lobbing tear gas. Lebanon is home to 450,000 Palestinian refugees, nearly 10 percent of the population. In a resolution long on rhetoric but short on concrete actions, Arab foreign ministers demanded the recognition decision be rescinded and urged the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution condemning Trumps decision. They acknowledged that Washington would most likely veto it. If the US vetoes such a resolution, the Arabs would seek a similar resolution in the UN General Assembly, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Malki told a news conference in Cairo. With few options for the Palestinians, and the Arab world preoccupied by other crises, Arab willingness to press the issue may be limited. In Paris, Netanyahu talked about his quiet but improving relations with Arab countries that look to Israel as an ally against Iran. \"There is in this a blessing, because this could help pave the way to an ultimate peace between us and our Palestinian neighbors and between us and the rest of the Arab world,\" he said. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, defended Trumps move. \"For those who want to say this is a bad idea, Ill tell you: Ask us five or 10 years from now if you still think its a bad idea. Because I really do think this is going to move the ball in the peace process,\" she told CNNs \"State of the Union.\"','WORLD-MIDDLE-EAST','','2017-12-11 08:49:00','AP | Dec 11, 2017, 08:49 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:34'),(334,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/this-is-the-real-reason-trump-declared-jerusalem-the-capital-of-israel/articleshow/62019779.cms','This is the real reason Trump declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62019775,width-400,resizemode-4/62019775.jpg]','LONDON: As the world continued to react to Donald Trumps fiercely controversial decision+ to move the US embassy to Israels Holy City, I received my most recent Prayergram post. It is, quite aptly, on the topic of the day: the \"Jerusalem Prayer\". One passage reads: \"God bless Donald J Trump! He understands the real principles behind success. It is not being good at what you do or understanding theory and practice. It is being on the right side of the blessing of God. Whoever blesses Israel shall be blessed: whoever curses Israel shall be cursed.\" And, lest there be any misunderstanding: \"If we bless Israel, regardless of its faults, lack of faith, both personally and organisationally, God bless us. While the world cries out, Donald J Trump who learned about the blessing on his mothers knee, masters the simple, plodding art of doing the right thing regardless of consequences.\" Prayergram send their posts not just to the believers, but others, like journalists who have written negatively about the Christian right or Donald Trump. This is intended to show us the error of our ways and also, if possible, save our souls. The \"Jerusalem Prayer\" was, the evangelists stress, of great importance, something that needed to be widely disseminated after Trump had announced that the US embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Jerusalem issue: All you need to know There are no fewer than 50 million evangelicals in America who, according to research, are convinced of the literal truth of Biblical prophecy. A recent survey found that 82 per cent of white evangelicals believe that God gave Israel to the Jewish people; a conviction shared by just 40 per cent of American Jews. Among these evangelicals there are those who believe in the prophecy of the \"End of Days\" foretelling Jewish control of all Jerusalem, a war of civilisations, and a choice of Jews to either embrace Christianity or die in the wrath of God. The decision to move the embassy does not actually have much popular support across the US population as a whole. A Brookings Institution survey found that it has the backing of only 31 per cent. Polls have also repeatedly found that a large majority of American Jews, who tend on average to have a better standard of education than the rest of US population, and are liberal by tradition, oppose the move. But Trumps Jerusalem declaration+ has been widely and enthusiastically welcomed by his religious base. Johnnie Moore, who acts as a spokesperson for the Trumps evangelical advisers stated: \"The issue was second only to concerns about the judiciary among the evangelical supporters. President Trump has yet again demonstrated to his evangelical supporters that he will do what he says he will do.\" For Paula White, a \"megachurch\" pastor from Florida who is close to Trump: \"once again, President Trump has shown the world what I have always known, he is a leader who is willing to do what is right however loud are the voices of the sceptics and the critics. Evangelicals are ecstatic, for Israel is to us a sacred place and the Jewish people are our dearest friends.\" There is also the money in this. Trumps campaign has received substantial funding from the Christian right and also hardline American Jewish promoters of Israel. They include Sheldon Adelson, the casino billionaire and Republican donor, who had given $20m (£14.9m) to a PAC (political action committee) which supported the Trump campaign and another $1.5m to the organisers of the Republican convention. Adelson has been lobbying the President persistently on the embassy transfer. Trump is not the only senior member of the administration to cultivate the Christian right. Vice President Mike Pence, who could be seen on TV standing behind Trump as the embassy announcement was made, with a reverent glow to his face, had pressed for a move to Jerusalem. And backing also came from Nikki Haley, the ambassador to the UN who tries her best to match Trump on hawkish rhetoric about smiting Americas enemies. She avidly courted the evangelical vote while Governor of South Carolina. There were those in the administration who pointed out that the Jerusalem move will inflame passions in the Middle East and the wider Muslim world; make a settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians even more difficult; make it harder to maintain coalitions against Islamist extremists and may put American lives in danger. They included Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defence Secretary James Mattis. Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law who is leading the Israel/Palestine peace initiative had apparently also urged caution initially. But Tillerson may soon be the latest casualty in the Trump administration, to be replaced by the recently appointed CIA director, Mike Pompeo, and Kushner is said to have changed his stance after talks with Adelson. The evangelists could always site God on their side. For Indiana pastor Paul Begley the embassy move is the beginning of \"End of Days\": \"The Jewish People — Ive been there, Im telling you — they believe when the Temples built, the Messiah will be revealed to them. Jesus will be revealed to the Jewish people, and they will embrace him.\" Laurie Cardoza-Moore, \"founder/president of Proclaiming Justice to The Nations\" wrote in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz: \"Christians recognise the Jews biblical connection through King Davids establishment of Jerusalem as the capital of ancient Israel and the location for both the first and second Temples. According to the prophets, Ezekiel, Isaiah and the Apostle John, all Israel awaits the rebuilding of the Third Temple. President Donald Trump may implement one of the most biblically historic initiatives of his presidency by allowing the first step of the Jerusalem Embassy Act to go into effect. \" But, as Cardoza-Moore points out, this was only the first step. It will take several years for the embassy to be moved, construction to start and suitable accommodation found for diplomats and staff. A lot can happen in that time. The whole thing may drift on the next election. Kushner may become the next person in the White House to be arrested in special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into the White Houses Russian connections after the charging of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Trump may himself be impeached or indicted. There is thus always the possibility, one has to accept, that the \"End of Days\" is not imminent. Armageddon will be put on hold. The Messiah will not appear for the time being and the Jews will not have to convert to Christianity or perish.','WORLD-MIDDLE-EAST','Kim Sengupta','2017-12-11 14:09:00','| The Independent | Updated: Dec 11, 2017, 14:09 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:34'),(335,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/un-calls-for-urgent-evacuation-of-137-sick-syrian-children/articleshow/62011021.cms','UN calls for urgent evacuation of 137 sick Syrian children','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62011013,width-400,resizemode-4/62011013.jpg]','BEIRUT: The United Nations childrens agency says 137 children stranded in a rebel-held suburb near the Syrian capital require immediate medical evacuation amid a crippling siege in which five have died from a lack of medical care.

A few hundred are believed to still be fighting as IS struggles to survive, having lost most of its territory to campaigns by Western-backed Syrian and Iraqi coalition armies. But what happened to the rest? Many thousands were certainly killed in the intense fighting, but US experts believe many have survived, posing a formidable threat going ahead. \"The issue is: how many have died? How many are still there and willing to fight? How many have gone elsewhere to fight?\" said Seth Jones, director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the Rand Corporation. \"How many have given up? I dont think we have a good answer.\" International counter-terror groups are putting huge efforts into answering those questions, working hard to name, count and track IS foreign fighters. In France, officials say, around 1,700 people went to Iraq and Syria since 2013 to join IS. Of those, 400 to 450 have been killed, and 250 returned to France. Foreign affairs minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on December 8 that about 500 are still in the Iraq-Syria theater, and for them it is now very hard to return to France. But that leaves another 500 whose whereabouts are unknown, many of them with the skills of war, wielding weapons and making bombs. Terrorism specialist Bruce Hoffman of Georgetown University estimated during a conference Wednesday that \"thousands\" have escaped the war zone. \"Today, some of them are most likely in the Balkans, lying low for the time being, waiting for the opportunity to infiltrate themselves to the rest of Europe,\" he said. Some have traveled to other jihadist fronts, according to Thomas Sanderson, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies Transnational Threats Project. For example, he said, at least 80 IS fighters from Morocco, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Yemen have joined since May the IS-allied Abu Sayyaf insurgents battling government forces in the southern Philippines. Local people in the northern Afghanistan province of Jowzjan have told AFP that French-speaking IS veterans — from France or northern African countries — have recently set up camp there. And they also have the option of other conflict zones in northern Africa, like Libya, Somalia, Yemen and elsewhere where jihadist groups akin to IS are conducting violent insurgencies. The defeat of IS on the battlefield in Syria in Iraq did not close off escape routes. IS fighters were able to blend in with civilian refugees or bribe their way to sneak into Turkey. Many dont have much choice but to continue to fight: they never had a plan to return to their home countries, where they face imprisonment in most cases, according to Jones. \"For many, it was a one-way trip. They wanted to live in the caliphate, permanently.

Protests in response to Trumps announcement, which departed from decades of US policy that the fate of Jerusalem should be decided through negotiations, have yet to relent across various Arab and Muslim countries in the region. Following Friday prayers, Palestinians in the West Bank and along the Gaza border set fire to tires and threw rocks at Israeli troops who responded with tear gas and live fire. Gaza Health Ministry Spokesman Ashraf al-Kidra said two Palestinians were killed from gunshots to the head. He identified one of the men as Ibrahim Abu Thraya, 29, a disabled man who had both legs amputated. He had taken part in several border skirmishes recently, images on social media show him carrying a Palestinian flag. Another 82 Palestinians were injured in clashes in several locations along Gazas border with Israel, at least five of whom were seriously wounded, he said. Another Palestinian died later from wounds sustained in clashes near Jerusalem, the health ministry said. Fridays deaths put to eight the number of Palestinians killed since Trumps declaration on December 6. The Israel military said thousands of \"Palestinian rioters rolled burning tires and hurled firebombs and rocks at security forces, who responded with tear gas and also \"fired selectively toward main instigators. Palestinians have been clashing with Israeli troops across the West Bank and along the Gaza border since President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israels capital last week. The Islamic militant group Hamas that rules Gaza has called for a new armed uprising against Israel in response to Trumps declaration. East Jerusalem is home to sensitive Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites and the fate of the territory is an emotionally charged issue at the heart of the conflict. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war from Jordan, as the capital of their hoped-for state. Israel says the entire city, including east Jerusalem, is its eternal capital. Palestinians were infuriated by Trumps announcement because they saw it as siding with Israel on the most sensitive issue in the conflict. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said Trumps move disqualified the US from continuing in its role as the traditional mediator of peace talks. Trump said his decision merely recognizes the reality that Jerusalem already serves as Israels capital and is not meant to prejudge the final borders of the city. Near the West Bank city of Ramallah, one Palestinian was shot and killed on Friday after he attacked an officer with a knife, stabbing him twice and wounding him moderately, said Israeli police. Spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said police are investigating reports that the attacker was wearing a suicide bomb vest or a fake explosive device. He added that they were also checking to see if he was posing as a journalist in order to get close to the officer. Video of the incident later emerged on the Facebook page of Palestinian newspaper Al-Hadath showing a man wearing a heavy black jacket retreating after apparently stabbing the Israeli officer. Israeli forces shoot him in the legs and again after he fell. A reporter is heard on the site saying the man was holding a knife. As two ambulances approached, forces fired several more gunshots at the man and medical teams had to wait before evacuating him. The Palestinian Health Ministry said he died of his wounds. In east Jerusalem, protesters waved Palestinian flags and chanted \"Jerusalem is Arab as they walked the narrow streets of the Old City. Some threw bottles of water at police. The clashes were fiercer in the West Bank where about 13 protesters were injured by live fire and 61 by rubber bullets while dozens more were treated for tear gas inhalation, according to the Red Crescent. In the city of Nablus, some Palestinians used slingshots to hurl rocks at Israeli security forces while others torched tires to use the thick plumes of smoke as cover. Others, masked, threw firebombs at an armored water cannon used to disperse crowds.','WORLD-MIDDLE-EAST','','2017-12-15 23:26:00','AP | Updated: Dec 15, 2017, 23:26 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:38'),(341,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/strikes-kill-12-in-rebel-run-yemen-prison-camp-rebel-tv/articleshow/62052557.cms','Strikes kill 12 in rebel-run Yemen prison camp, says rebel TV','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62052846,width-400,resizemode-4/62052846.jpg]','SANAA: Saudi-led air strikes on a prison camp run by rebels in Yemen killed 12 people and wounded 80 on Wednesday, the rebels Al-Masirah TV reported. There has been no let-up in the air campaign against the rebels that a Saudi-led coalition has been waging since March 2015 despite an appeal by UN chief Antonio Guterres on Sunday for a renewed push to end the \"stupid war\". All of the casualties in the pre-dawn strikes on the camp in the capital Sanaa were prisoners, rebel television said. An AFP photographer saw rebel fighters carrying away bodies from the rubble of heavily damaged buildings. One of the guards, Mohammed al-Aqel, said the strikes had begun at 1:00 am (2200 GMT Tuesday). He said a first strike had damaged one wing of the jail prompting some of the prisoners to try to escape but it was then almost flattened by a second strike. Three further strikes damaged two other prison buildings and the perimeter wall, Aqel added. On Sunday, Saudi-led strikes on a rebel training camp northwest of the capital killed at least 26 rebel fighters, security sources said. On Friday, a strike on a rebel-controlled television station in Sanaa killed four guards. The raids come with Yemen plunged deeper into turmoil by the killing of ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh by the rebels after their uneasy alliance collapsed.

Tests later found that the warheads contained a crude blister agent resembling sulfur mustard, a banned chemical weapon intended to burn a victims skin and respiratory tract. The improvised chemical rockets were the latest in a procession of weapons developed by the Islamic State during a jihadi arms-manufacturing spree without recent analogue. Irregular fighting forces, with limited access to global arms markets, routinely manufacture their own weapons. But the Islamic State took the practice to new levels, with outputs \"unlike anything weve ever seen\" from a nonstate force, said Solomon H. Black, a State Department official who tracks and analyzes weapons. Islamic State: What happened to all the foreign fighters? Around 40,000 people travelled from around the world to take up arms for IS as it occupied territory in Syria and Iraq and declared a caliphate in 2014. Many thousands were certainly killed in the intense fighting, but US experts believe many have survived, posing a formidable threat going ahead. Humanitarian de-miners, former military explosive ordnance disposal technicians and arms analysts working in areas captured from the Islamic State provided The New York Times with dozens of reports and scores of photographs and drawings detailing weapons the militant organization has developed since 2014, when it established a self-declared caliphate in Syria and Iraq. The records show the work of a jihadi hive mind — a system of armaments production that combined research and development, mass production and organized distribution to amplify the militant organizations endurance and power. The resulting weapons, used against the Islamic States armed foes on many fronts and against civilians who did not support its rule, were variously novel and familiar. At times they were exceptionally cruel. One report noted that before being expelled from Ramadi, Islamic State fighters buried a massive explosive charge under a group of homes and wired it to the electrical system in one of the buildings. The houses were thought to be safe. But when a family returned and connected a generator, their home was blown apart in an enormous blast, according to Snoor Tofiq, national operations manager for Norwegian Peoples Aid, which is clearing improvised weapons from areas that the Islamic State left. The entire family, he said, was killed. Craig McInally, also an operations manager for the Norwegian de-mining organization, described indiscriminate inventions elsewhere — including four seemingly abandoned space heaters and a generator recovered near Mosul. The heaters and generator, useful to displaced civilians and combatants alike, were packed with hidden explosives. The bombs had been configured, McInally said, so that if a person approached them or tried to move them, they would explode. Taken together, the scope and scale of Islamic State production demonstrated the perils of a determined militant organization allowed to pursue its ambitions in a large, ungoverned space. Some weapon components, for example, were essentially standardized, including locally manufactured injection-molded munition fuzes, shoulder-fired rockets, mortar ammunition, modular bomb parts and plastic-bodied land mines that underwent generations of upgrades. Many were produced in industrial quantities. The findings also included apparent prototypes of weapons that either were not selected for mass production or were abandoned in development, including projectiles loaded with caustic soda and shoulder-fired rockets containing blister agent. While the Islamic State has been routed from almost all its territory in Iraq and Syria, security officials say its advances pose risks elsewhere, as its members move on to other countries, its foreign members return home and veterans of its arms-production network pool and share knowledge and techniques online. \"Theyre spreading this knowledge all over the world,\" said Ernest Barajas Jr., a former Marine explosive ordnance disposal technician who has worked with ordnance-clearing organizations in areas occupied by the Islamic State. \"Its going to the Philippines, its in Africa.\" He added, \"This stuffs going to continue to grow.\" One reason for the Islamic States level of sophistication was clear: Its armaments programs grew out of the insurgencies fighting the US occupation of Iraq from 2003 through 2011. Sunni and Shia militant groups became adept at making improvised bombs, both from conventional munitions abandoned in 2003 by Iraqs defeated military, and with ingredients that bomb-makers prepared themselves. US officials say certain Shia groups received technical assistance and components from Iran. Sunni bomb-makers also fielded chemical weapons, sometimes by combining explosive devices with chlorine, a toxic substance with legal applications, and other times in bombs made from degraded chemical rockets or shells left from Iraqs defunct chemical warfare program. The Islamic State, which evolved from al-Qaeda in Iraq, built upon its predecessors lethal industry. The groups larger success since also played a role. When the Islamic State seized swaths of territory and major cities in 2014, it took control of shops and factories with hydraulic presses, forges, computer-driven machine tools and plastic injection-molding machines. It also moved into at least one technical college and university lab. This infrastructure positioned the Islamic State for an arms-production breakout. Behind the capacity was an armaments bureaucracy that supervised product development and manufacture, said Damien Spleeters, head of operations in Iraq and Syria for Conflict Armament Research, a private arms-monitoring and investigative firm that has done field work in both countries during the war. The system was resilient, Spleeters said. One of the Islamic States projects, a series of recoilless launchers that gained prominence late in the battle for Mosul, in northern Iraq, was built from the ground up even while militants were pressured in combat from multiple foes on multiple fronts. \"It just kept going,\" Spleeters said of the technical advancements. \"They could develop stuff even as they lost territories.\" The Islamic States arms bureaucracy was also disciplined. Detonating cord used in improvised explosive devices was measured and allotted down to the centimeter, Spleeters said. When a stock ran out, management would fill out a request form for more. The material would be resupplied. McInally said the groups armament production appeared centralized and carefully considered. As de-miners have found weapons, he said, they have routinely encountered improvised devices with a modular design that allowed for the Islamic States fighters to choose from uniform parts and assemble devices quickly. The separate parts were issued distinctly, to be combined before use. \"Its a collection of pressure plates, a collection of charges, a collection of switches,\" McInally said. \"Components that can be connected as necessary. Its clever. Its impressive.\" The New York Times is withholding technical details of weapons and explosive mixtures described in this article to prevent the spread of information useful to copycats. Barajas said the explosive charges themselves were further standardized — via a \"homemade explosive\" with a recipe the group tweaked and produced at an industrial scale. The mixture, he said, is a widely known combination of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and aluminum with a long history of use in many conflicts, including in Iraq. But the Islamic State improved the explosive with the addition of another material that makes it easier to detonate. The Times previously documented the Islamic States importation of large amounts of ammonium nitrate from Turkey, along with sections of heavy pipe. McInally said the group also standardized other items: supplemental charges for mortar rounds to extend their range; a common fuze with a spring-loaded striker assembly machined from an over-the-counter bolt; and an improvised bomb — he said de-miners refer to it as a land mine — that was fielded in a standard-sized plastic tub. The mines resemble an Italian-made anti-personnel mine called the VS-50, though the Islamic States version is much larger, prompting de-miners to dryly refer to it as the \"VS-500.\" As time passed, newly produced VS-500 mines became increasingly water-resistant, extending their life in the ground. Similarly, the striker fuzes the Islamic State has fielded show signs of being made resistant to moisture and rust. The first-generation land mines, McInally said, were not well made. \"They didnt weather well,\" he said. But by the time the Islamic State was defeated in Mosul, he said, it had improved the design and salted the battlefield and villages with weapons \"that last a long, long time.\" The Islamic State has also engaged in organized scavenging, including collecting dud US-made bombs dropped by coalition warplanes and repurposing their explosive power. One set of photos provided by a de-miner shows how the group set up an open-air chop shop to cut open unexploded US aircraft bombs and remove the explosive inside. These explosives tend to be more powerful and more reliable than homemade explosives. Barajas said the Islamic State put what it had scavenged to priority use — in suicide attacks. \"Every time Id run an explosive test on the ordnance buried in the ground, if I found it connected to the pressure switches, it would come back as homemade explosives,\" he said. But the explosives in suicide vests and belts, he added, were compounds, including RDX and TNT, extracted from conventional ordnance. Not all the Islamic States developments have been effective. When experimental designs failed, Islamic State engineers made changes or moved on. According to a US government official who examined an analysis of the rocket-propelled grenade filled with blister agent, the weapons would probably not fly a predictable and accurate path. X-rays, he said, showed that they had been only partly filled, and were unbalanced. Similarly, the Islamic State seemed to struggle with a series of mortars filled with caustic soda, or lye, a strongly alkaline compound that is sold in a heavy flake form and sometimes used as a drain cleaner. Dozens of locally produced mortar projectiles filled with caustic soda were found by de-miners in Manbij, Syria, in late 2016. Barajas analyzed the discovery. \"Caustic soda is extremely hazardous. Itll burn your skin,\" he said. \"If you inhale it, itll cause death.\" But the material is also corrosive, so much so that it damaged the interior of the shells the Islamic State had used to hold it. He said the Islamic State tried loading 120-millimeter mortar rounds with caustic soda, but the munitions rusted to the point of exuding salts. They could not be safely fired. \"I think once they got this bad reaction, they moved away from this,\" Barajas said. Put to Brutal Use Many of the Islamic States bombs have been used against the military and police forces fighting it. Aso Mohammed, a Kurdish de-miner with the Swiss Foundation for Mine Action, said that by his estimates, improvised explosive devices have been responsible for 60 percent of casualties of Kurdish peshmerga soldiers in Iraqs north. But other uses were consistent with the Islamic States well-documented disregard for international law and humanitarian concerns evident in their abductions, public executions, production of snuff films and bombings of public spaces. In a prepared statement, the US military in Baghdad noted that coalition forces have recovered and destroyed booby-trapped teddy bears. De-miners and their supervisors in Iraq frequently trade reports and details of other Islamic State-made booby traps, among them dolls, stuffed animals and plastic trucks, as well as teapots, fire extinguishers, flashlights and copies of the Quran. Two de-miners, Steve Kosier and Mohammed, of the Swiss demining organization, said the Islamic States locally made weapons had evolved in a predictably sinister fashion. Improvised devices that once were connected to a single plate that would cause the bomb to explode were later in the campaign connected to several plates — an adaptation intended to slow de-miners as they cleared buildings, roads and terrain. Kosier said he had disabled one makeshift bomb that \"had four pressure plates surrounding the container with a 9-volt battery for each plate.\" Each plate was connected by a separate electrical circuit to a container of homemade high explosives, which in turn had an \"anti-lift device\" beneath it — essentially a booby trap added to an already complex booby trap. The ambition behind such a trap, de-miners said, is to kill people trying to make the Islamic States former turf safe.','WORLD-MIDDLE-EAST','John Ismay, Thomas Gibbons Neff, CJ Chivers','2017-12-16 18:00:00','| NYT News Service | Dec 16, 2017, 18:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:40'),(345,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/emboldened-by-change-some-uzbekistan-imams-turn-on-loudspeakers-for-call-to-prayer/articleshow/62024037.cms','Emboldened by change, some Uzbekistan imams turn on loudspeakers for call to prayer','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62025280,width-400,resizemode-4/62025280.jpg]','TASHKENT: Some mosques in Uzbekistan are starting to broadcast the Muslim call to prayer from loudspeakers for the first time in a decade as they take advantage of a more tolerant official attitude toward Islam since President Islam Karimov died last year. The imams are amplifying the Adhan call to prayer without asking for government permission. Under Karimov, an imam who took such a liberty would have faced losing his job or possible imprisonment. The new boldness is a response to decisions by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to liberalise the ex-Soviet nation of 32 million people whose main religion is Islam. Mirziyoyev has overseen the release of several prominent political prisoners, relaxed some security measures and this week he pardoned 2,700 convicts, saying that in the past many sentences had been unjust. Western countries and human rights groups accused the government of repression under Karimov who ruled the Central Asian nation from 1989 until his death in September 2016. The leader cracked down on public displays of Islamic practice including hijabs and beards because he feared the country was vulnerable to Islamist militancy. His government blamed militants for bombings in the capital in 1999 and unrest in the city of Andijan in 2005. Around 200 people died in all, according to official figures, and the incidents were the bloodiest since Uzbekistan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. After government troops clashed with armed protesters in Andijan, Uzbek mosques stopped using loudspeakers for the call to prayer though the practice was never formally banned. TAKING THE INITIATIVE Over the last few months, however, some imams have begun to broadcast the Adhan from mosques again. A Reuters reporter heard it at three mosques in Tashkent, though it was only audible to people near the buildings. The call is part of the soundscape in many Muslim cities, blasting from speakers on minarets five times each day and extra loud on Friday, which is the day of prayer. Worshippers in Tashkent welcomed the change. \"People should hear that its prayer time. Thats what Muslim life is about,\" said a young man outside one of the mosques. He declined to give his identity. A cleric at one of Tashkents main mosques said the matter was being discussed within the Muslim Board of Uzbekistan, which is close to the government. No ruling has been made. \"Some imams took the initiative\" and turned on their loudspeakers at their own risk once the talks with the Board had started, said the cleric who declined to give his name because he was not authorised to comment publicly. Another source close to the clergy said some imams had argued that without a formal ban there was no need for formal permission to restart. There have been no reports of clerics being prosecuted for breaking the informal ban. The government declined to comment on the matter. RETURN FROM EXILE Nurulloh Muhammad Raufkhon, an Uzbek writer who recently returned to Tashkent after living in exile for more than a year, said he saw the cautious return of Adhan as a sign of a broader change in the states attitude to religion under Mirziyoyev. \"(Mirziyoyevs) decree on developing and introducing Halal standards was another important step,\" he said. Mirziyoyev ordered the government last month to develop standards for food products that adhere to Islamic dietary laws, which prohibit the consumption of pork and alcohol among other things. The move could boost Uzbek sales of halal food both domestically and overseas. \"Previously, we were banned from using the word halal. I know because I used to work at ... a religious magazine .... Halal restaurants were closed down. The word halal was removed from product labels, he said. In another break with Karimov-era policy, Mirziyoyev said in September Uzbekistan had removed about 16,000 people from a 17,000-strong security blacklist of potential Muslim religious extremists and dissidents. He said he wanted \"to bring them (back) into our society and educate them.\" The issue of Islamist militancy in Uzbekistan has spread beyond the countrys borders. This year, at least 60 people have died in attacks abroad carried out by Uzbek nationals or ethnic Uzbeks. The most deadly was a shooting in an Istanbul nightclub in which 39 people died. In the late 1990s, the government fought the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a militant group that sought to make Uzbekistan an Islamic state. It later moved to Afghanistan to join forces with the Taliban. Hundreds of Uzbeks have also joined Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Authorities fear radicalized youths may return home. \"Nowadays they are talking about driving the terrorists out of Syria,\" Mirziyoyev said in a public speech this month. \"But the question is, where will they go now? We should think about it.\" At the same time, he said many of Uzbekistans convicted prisoners had been sentenced unjustly and he vowed to crack down on abuses such as torture and fabricated evidence.','WORLD-MIDDLE-EAST','','2017-12-11 20:18:00','Reuters | Updated: Dec 11, 2017, 20:18 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:41'),(346,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/self-goals-a-bigger-threat-to-bjp-than-opponent-rahul/deep-focus/Why-Una-is-not-a-WhatsApp-uprising/articleshow/53473318.cms','Why Una is not a WhatsApp uprising','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-53473332,width-400,resizemode-4/53473332.jpg]','A viral video may have been crucial for mobilising Dalits but Gujarat has a long history of fighting the caste chokehold Mota Samadhiyala village, in Una block in Gujarats Gir-Somnath district, has now become a place-name for social terror. The video that went viral a few weeks ago, of cow-protection vigilantes beating seven Dalit men for skinning a dead cow, was recorded and spread by the gau rakshaks themselves. But that video had big consequences. It wrenched attention to the scale of crimes against Dalits. Gujarat chief minister Anandiben Patel visited the victims, as did a stream of opposition leaders. \"Anyone who watched the video was shaken to the core. Also, this incident comes one year before the assembly polls, so parties that remained numb to Dalit issues are now seeing their chance,\" says Kaushik Parmar, an Ahmedabad-based activist who is part of the Una Dalit Atyachar Ladat Samiti, formed to keep up the pressure. The external effects of the Una incident are clear to see — the high-profile visits, the parliamentary discussions on atrocities against Dalits. But it has done something more profound. It has mobilised Dalits across Gujarat, and around India. In Gujarat, finally many have shunned this \"traditional occupation\" of skinning cows, dumping carcasses outside public buildings to show their rejection of this cruel social order. \"If all the 31 gau rakshaks are not caught by August 1, our agitation will start again,\" says Deven Vanvi of the Saurashtra Dalit Sangathan. This Dalit mobilisation is seemingly leaderless — there is no single instigating centre, no one person to negotiate with. It spreads through networks, and uses social media to circulate news and link faraway comrades in a common mission. Just as the Rohith Vemula suicide became a defining moment for Dalit consciousness, so has the Una violence, says Ashok Bharti, chairman of the National Confederation of Dalit organisations. \"As Ambedkar said, my humiliation is my power. It is now clear to Dalits that it is time to mobilise and react. Modis first nightmare has begun,\" he says. \"The Una incident will have a ripple effect in places like Uttar Pradesh also, where this traditional occupation and Hindutva intimidation are real issues,\" says political scientist Badri Narayan. But this assertion in the region is not a new phenomenon, a function of WhatsApp or tech-enabled connectivity or a reaction to Hindutva alone. Caste has been a chokehold, irrespective of the government in power, and Dalit groups have put up a fight for half a century. \"Saurashtra was an assortment of princely states under Darbar rulers. Babasaheb Ambedkar came here in 1931 and 1939, and his comrades worked in the community for years to raise consciousness,\" says Jayanti Makadia of the Gujarat Dalit Sangathan, an umbrella group of Dalit organisations, trusts, sabhas and panches. \"Dalits struggled for land rights, from the 60s to the 80s, even massing into jails. From the 90s to the mid-2000s, we fought communalism, refusing to be foot soldiers against Muslims,\" he says. In 2013, Junagarh enacted a large-scale Dalit conversion to Buddhism, as a message to the BJP government and the Hindu hierarchy. The intense anti-reservation movement in Gujarat since the 1970s, central to its politics, has always turned on Dalits, Makadia says, even though they were not the beneficiaries of the later round of reservations. \"The word reservation has still stuck to us like skin,\" he says. But now, every tehsil and locality has Dalit groups that come together when an event occurs, to provide legal support, mobilise and present their side to the state. \"We need more efforts like BAMCEF and DS4,\" says Vanvi. (The All-India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation and the Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti, were formed to push for Dalit interests.) After all, for all the casteism that exists, \"nobody would ever dare to attempt this kind of violence in the south, where Dalits have been more politicized and radical,\" says K Satyanarayana, scholar, writer and anti-caste activist. But Dalit mobilisation has not aimed for direct political power in Gujarat, partly because their population of 7.1% does not give them the numerical clout. \"But if they can unite, they can be a significant pressure group on parties,\" says Narayan. While the Congress first claimed them as part of its social coalition — KHAM — the BJP has tried to incorporate them in the Hindutva project. \"The problem is that some Dalit communities still prefer to share the spoils of power or other benefits rather than fighting for other Dalits,\" says Makadia, referring to the vankar community that has collaborated with the Congress and then the BJP. Others, like Bharti, feel that \"the quest for a political movement has distracted from the need to build social resilience among Dalits\". In Gujarat, that resilience is sorely needed. The rate of crime against Dalits hovers above the national average, according to NCRB data, particularly murders. A recent Rajya Sabha question showed a dramatic upsurge in 2015. And yet, in 2013, only 2.5% of the registered cases of crimes against Dalits resulted in a conviction. That figure stood at 6% in 2015. There is an official backlog of 56,000 government jobs, and land rights are an ongoing struggle. The attacks on Dalits have grown, just as their awareness and assertion on matters of land, employment, and rightful share in resources has increased. \"When you know your rights, thats when the violence happens. When you dont accept what they say, thats when the violence increases,\" says Vanvi.

Hydrogen peroxide was the vital ingredient in rock pores around underwater heat vents that set in train a sequence of chemical reactions that led to the first forms of life, according to lead researcher Rowena Ball from the Australian National University (ANU). \"The origin of life is one of the hardest problems in all of science, but it is also one of the most important,\" said Ball, from the ANU. Researchers made a model using hydrogen peroxide and porous rock that simulated the dynamic, messy environment that hosted the origin of life. \"Hydrogen peroxide played multiple roles in the emergence of living systems, and this study investigated how it ensured the randomly fluctuating temperatures and pH levels necessary to energise the production of a chemical world that made life on Earth possible,\" she said. The study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science provides new and valuable guidelines in the search for extraterrestrial life. \"Our simulations reveal the importance of long rock pores or lengthy, interconnected porous structures in enabling the creation of long, large molecules,\" Ball added. The research advances upon previous studies by modelling the flow of reactive species through porous rock rather than through a single pore. Ball said the high temperature fluctuations must not rise too high or occur too often. \"The system needs to spend enough time at higher temperatures to carry out essential synthetic reactions, but not so much that the reactants are totally consumed or destroyed. We call this the Goldilocks distribution,\" she said. \"This effectively gives us the fundamental equation of life. It says that for life to begin and persist, the habitat must exhibit a specific range of temperature fluctuations,\" she said. Hydrogen peroxide also promoted the evolution of enzymes called catalases that prevented a second origin of life event. \"The ubiquitous presence of life, and hence catalases, in all habitable environments prevent hydrogen peroxide from accumulating sufficiently anywhere to drive a second origin event,\" Ball said.','HOME-SCIENCE','','2017-11-13 12:37:00','PTI | Updated: Nov 13, 2017, 12:37 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:50'),(348,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/massive-black-holes-may-be-lurking-on-edge-of-milky-way/articleshow/61374135.cms','Massive black holes may be lurking on edge of Milky Way','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61374129,width-400,resizemode-4/61374129.jpg]','NEW YORK: The outskirts of spiral galaxies like our own could be crowded with colliding black holes of massive proportions and a prime location for hunting the sources of gravitational waves, a study led by an Indian origin researcher has found. Researchers at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the US identified an overlooked region that may be rife with orbiting black holes and the origin of gravitational-wave chirps heard by observatories in the US and Italy. Identifying the host galaxies of merging massive black holes could help explain how orbiting pairs of black holes form. Conditions favourable for blackhole mergers exist in the outer gas disks of big spiral galaxies, according to Sukanya Chakrabarti, assistant professor at RIT and lead author of the study published in Astrophysical Journal Letters. Until now, small satellite or dwarf galaxies were thought to have the most suitable environment for hosting blackhole populations: a sparse population of stars, unpolluted with heavy metals like iron, gold and platinum - elements spewed in supernovae explosions - and inefficient winds that leave massive stars intact. Chakrabarti realised the edges of galaxies like the Milky Wav have similar environments to dwarf galaxies but with a major advantage - big galaxies are easier to find. \"The metal content in the outer disks of spiral galaxies is also quite low and should be rife with black holes in this large area,\" Chakrabarti said. \"This study shows that, when predicting or interpreting observations of black holes, we need to account not only for differences between different types of galaxies but also the range of environments that occur inside of them,\" said Richard OShaughnessy, assistant professor at RIT and a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. A deeper understanding of the universe is possible now that scientists can combine gravitational wave astronomy with traditional measurements of bands of light. Existing research shows that even black holes, which are too dense for light to escape, have a gravitational wave and an optical counterpart, remnants of matter from the stellar collapse from which they formed.','HOME-SCIENCE','','2017-10-31 21:45:00','PTI | Oct 31, 2017, 21:45 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:50'),(349,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/ancient-ocean-remnants-found-on-dwarf-planet-ceres-nasa/articleshow/61271470.cms','Ancient ocean remnants found on dwarf planet Ceres: NASA','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61272217,width-400,resizemode-4/61272217.jpg]','WASHINGTON: NASAs Dawn mission to Ceres has found the evidence of residual liquid left over from an ancient global ocean on the dwarf planet. The researchers found that Ceres crust is a mixture of ice, salts and hydrated materials that were subjected to past and possibly recent geologic activity and that this crust represents most of that ocean. They suggest that there is a softer, easily deformable layer beneath Ceres rigid surface crust, which could be the signature of residual liquid. \"More and more, we are learning that Ceres is a complex, dynamic world that may have hosted a lot of liquid water in the past, and may still have some underground,\" said Julie Castillo-Rogez, Dawn project scientist based at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. Researchers led by Anton Ermakov, a postdoctoral researcher at JPL, used shape and gravity data measurements from the Dawn mission to determine the internal structure and composition of Ceres. The research supports the possibility that Ceres is geologically active - if not now, then it may have been in the recent past. Three craters - Occator, Kerwan and Yalode - and Ceres solitary tall mountain, Ahuna Mons, are all associated with \"gravity anomalies,\" researchers said. This means discrepancies between the scientists models of Ceres gravity and what Dawn observed in these four locations can be associated with subsurface structures. Researchers led by Roger Fu at Harvard University in the US investigated the strength and composition of Ceres crust and deeper interior by studying the dwarf planets topography. By modelling how Ceres crust flows, Fu and colleagues found it is likely a mixture of ice, salts, rock and an additional component believed to be a clathrate hydrate. A clathrate hydrate is a cage of water molecules surrounding a gas molecule. This structure is 100 to 1,000 times stronger than water ice, despite having nearly the same density. The researchers believe Ceres once had more pronounced surface features, but they have smoothed out over time. This type of flattening of mountains and valleys requires a high-strength crust resting on a more deformable layer, which Fu and colleagues interpret to contain a little bit of liquid.','HOME-SCIENCE','','2017-10-27 16:43:00','PTI | Updated: Oct 27, 2017, 16:43 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:51'),(350,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/e-cigarettes-may-cause-inflammatory-lung-diseases-study/articleshow/61181598.cms','E-cigarettes may cause inflammatory lung diseases: Study','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61181592,width-400,resizemode-4/61181592.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Vaping may not only be as harmful as smoking regular cigarettes, but can also trigger unique immune responses in lungs, causing deadly inflammatory diseases, a study warns. Immune responses are the biological reactions of cells and fluids to an outside substance the body does not recognise as its own. Such immune responses play roles in disease, including lung disease spurred on by cigarette use. The study, published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, looked at possible biomarkers of harm in the lungs and found that in some ways using e-cigarettes could be just as bad as smoking cigarettes. Researchers from University North Carolina (UNC) in the US compared sputum samples from 15 e-cigarette users, 14 current cigarette smokers and 15 non-smokers. They found e-cigarette users uniquely exhibited significant increases in: Neutrophil granulocyte - and neutrophil-extracellular-trap (NET)-related proteins in their airways. Although neutrophils are important in fighting pathogens, left unchecked neutrophils can contribute to inflammatory lung diseases, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis, researchers said. E-cigarette users also showed significant increases in NETs outside the lung, researchers said. NETs are associated with cell death in the epithelial and endothelium, the tissues lining blood vessels and organs, researchers said. The study also found that e-cigarettes produced some of the same negative consequences as cigarettes. Both e-cigarette and cigarette users exhibited significant increases in biomarkers of oxidative stress and activation of innate defence mechanisms associated with lung disease. \"Our data shows that e-cigarettes have a signature of harm in the lung that is both similar to what we see in cigarette smokers and unique in other ways,\" said Mehmet Kesimer, from the UNC School of Medicine. \"This research challenges the concept that switching to e-cigarettes is a healthier alternative,\" Kesimer said.','HOME-SCIENCE','','2017-10-23 12:17:00','PTI | Oct 23, 2017, 12:17 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:52'),(351,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/nasa-extends-dawn-mission-at-dwarf-planet-ceres/articleshow/61151848.cms','Nasa extends Dawn mission at dwarf planet Ceres','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61151879,width-400,resizemode-4/61151879.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Nasa has approved a second extension of the Dawn mission at Ceres, allowing the spacecraft to get a closer look at the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. During this extension, the spacecraft will descend to lower altitudes than ever before at the dwarf planet, which it has been orbiting since March 2015. The spacecraft will continue at Ceres for the remainder of its science investigation and will remain in a stable orbit indefinitely after its fuel runs out. The Dawn flight team is studying ways to manoeuvre the spacecraft into a new elliptical orbit, which may take it to less than 200 kilometres from the surface of Ceres at closest approach. Previously, Dawns lowest altitude was 385 kilometres. A priority of the second Ceres mission extension is collecting data with Dawns gamma ray and neutron spectrometer, which measures the number and energy of gamma rays and neutrons. This information is important for understanding the composition of Ceres uppermost layer and how much ice it contains. The spacecraft also will take visible-light images of Ceres surface geology with its camera, as well as measurements of Ceres mineralogy with its visible and infrared mapping spectrometer. The extended mission at Ceres additionally allows Dawn to be in orbit while the dwarf planet goes through perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, which will occur in April 2018. At close proximity to the Sun, more ice on Ceres surface may turn to water vapour, which may, in turn, contribute to the weak transient atmosphere detected by the European Space Agencys Herschel Space Observatory before Dawns arrival. Building on Dawns findings, researchers have hypothesised that water vapour may be produced in part from energetic particles from the Sun interacting with ice in Ceres shallow surface. Scientists will combine data from ground-based observatories with Dawns observations to further study these phenomena as Ceres approaches perihelion. Instead, it will carry out as much science as it can in its final planned orbit, where it will stay even after it can no longer communicate with Earth. Mission planners estimate that the spacecraft can continue operating until the second half of 2018. Dawn is the only mission ever to orbit two extraterrestrial targets. It orbited giant asteroid Vesta for 14 months from 2011 to 2012, then continued on to Ceres, where it has been in orbit since March 2015.','HOME-SCIENCE','','2017-10-20 13:50:00','PTI | Oct 20, 2017, 13:50 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:53'),(352,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/simple-water-test-could-reduce-bone-disease-in-india/articleshow/61640563.cms','Simple water test could reduce bone disease in India','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61640715,width-400,resizemode-4/61640715.jpg]','LONDON: A simple colour-changing test to detect fluoride in drinking water could help prevent skeletal fluorosis, the crippling bone disease, in developing countries like India, says a study. While low amounts of fluoride are beneficial for healthy teeth, high levels of fluoride can weaken bones, leading to skeletal fluorosis. This disease causes crippling deformities of the spine and joints, especially in children whose skeletons are still forming. \"Whilst a small amount of fluoride is good for your teeth and prevents tooth decay, high levels are toxic and can cause crippling deformities that are irreversible,\" said lead researcher Simon Lewis from University of Bath in Britain. When water passes over certain minerals, it can dissolve fluoride, which results in elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water sources in parts of India, China, East Africa, and North America. Levels of fluoride in drinking water are routinely monitored and controlled at treatment works in developed countries. However in areas of the world where there is no piped water system or treatment works, people rely on drawing untreated water from wells, which can often be contaminated with higher than recommended levels of fluoride. The amounts of fluoride in the groundwater can vary due to weather events, with levels fluctuating hugely when there is a lot of rain. The new research published in the journal Chemical Communications details a simple colour-changing test that detects high levels of fluoride quickly and selectively. \"Most water quality monitoring systems need a lab and power supply and a trained operator to work them. What weve developed is a molecule that simply changes colour in a few minutes which can tell you whether the level of fluoride is too high,\" Lewis said. \"This technology is in the very early stages, but wed like to develop this technology into test strips, similar to litmus paper, that allow people without any scientific training to perform a test that is low cost, rapid and robust,\" Lewis added.','HOME-SCIENCE','','2017-11-14 13:00:00','IANS | Nov 14, 2017, 13:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:53'),(353,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/magic-mushrooms-may-help-curb-crimes-study/articleshow/61200072.cms','Magic mushrooms may help curb crimes: Study','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61200069,width-400,resizemode-4/61200069.jpg]','TORONTO: Consumption of psychedelic drugs such as magic mushrooms or LSD may decrease the likelihood of antisocial criminal behaviour, a study claims.

The study, published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, found that respondents who have used psychedelic drugs had 27 per cent decreased odds of larceny or theft, and 22 per cent decreased odds of arrest for a violent crime in the past year. At the same time, lifetime use of other illicit substances was generally associated with increased odds of criminal behaviour, researchers said. \"The development of innovative and effective interventions to prevent criminal behaviour is an obvious priority,\" said Peter Hendricks from University of Alabama in the US. \"Our findings suggest the protective effects of classic psychedelic use are attributable to genuine reductions in antisocial behaviour rather than reflecting improved evasion of arrest,\" he said. The positive effects associated with classic psychedelic use appear to be reliable. Given the costs of criminal behaviour, the potential represented by this treatment paradigm is significant, researchers said.','HOME-SCIENCE','','2017-10-24 14:48:00','PTI | Oct 24, 2017, 14:48 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:54'),(354,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/gene-therapy-helps-treat-life-threatening-skin-disease/articleshow/61604124.cms','Gene therapy helps treat life-threatening skin disease','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61604134,width-400,resizemode-4/61604134.jpg]','BERLIN: In a first, scientists have successfully treated a child suffering from extensive skin damage due to a genetic disease using transplants derived from genetically modified cells. The boy suffers from epidermolysis bullosa, a genetic skin disease that had destroyed about 80 per cent of the outermost layer of his skin. After all established therapies had failed, the medical team from at the Ruhr-Universitat Bochum in Germany and University of Modena in Italy decided to try an experimental approach. They transplanted skin derived from genetically modified stem cells onto the wound surfaces. Thanks to the successful therapy, the boy is now - two years after the treatment - able to participate in his familys life and social life. Epidermolysis bullosa is the scientific name of a congenital skin disease that is currently considered to be incurable. Its underlying mechanism is a defect in protein-forming genes that are essential for skin regeneration. Even minor stress can result in blisters, wounds, and skin loss with scar formation. Depending on disease severity, internal organs may likewise be affected, leading to critical dysfunctions. The disease significantly reduces the patients quality of life; often it is also life-threatening. By the time, seven-year-old Hassan was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit at Katholisches Klinikum Bochum in June 2015, 60 per cent of his epidermis was lost. \"He suffered from severe sepsis with high fever, and his body weight had dropped to a mere 17 kilogrammes - a life- threatening condition,\" said Tobias Rothoeft, Consultant at the University Childrens Hospital at Katholisches Klinikum Bochum. Due to the poor prognosis, doctors opted for an experimental therapy: the transplantation of genetically modified epidermal stem cells. The cells were obtained from the patient via skin biopsy. The transplants were applied to the boys arms and legs, entire back, flanks, and partially to the stomach, neck and face as well. \"Overall, 0.94 square metres of transgenic epidermis were transplanted onto the young patient in order to cover all defects, accounting for 80 per cent of his entire body surface,\" said Tobias Hirsch, head consultant at the department of plastic surgery. Following the first transplantation in October 2015, the patients condition began to improve. The transgenic stem cells formed a new epidermis with intact binding proteins in all transplanted areas. The integration of the intact gene through retroviral gene transfer into the genome of the epidermal stem cells had been successful and was proven to be stable. In February last year, the patient was discharged. Today, almost two years after the experimental therapy was initiated, high-quality, stress-resistant skin with intact hydrolipid film, as well as early formation of hair, researchers said. No scar contractures have appeared in transplanted areas. Hassan is attending school again and is actively taking part in his familys social life, they said.','HOME-SCIENCE','','2017-11-11 12:06:00','PTI | Nov 11, 2017, 12:06 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:54'),(355,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/humans-interbred-with-neanderthals-in-western-asia-study/articleshow/61226823.cms','Humans interbred with Neanderthals in Western Asia: Study','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61227109,width-400,resizemode-4/61227109.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Western Asia is the most likely spot where modern humans first encountered and had sexual rendezvous with a different hominid species - the Neanderthals, a study suggests. When the ancestors of modern humans migrated out of Africa, they passed through the Middle East and Turkey before heading deeper into Asia and Europe. At this important crossroads, it is thought that they encountered and had sexual rendezvous with the Neanderthals. Genomic evidence shows that this ancient interbreeding occurred, and Western Asia is the most likely spot where it happened. Researchers at the University at Buffalo (UB) in the US explored the legacy of these interspecies trysts, with a focus on Western Asia, where the first relations may have occurred. The research, published in the journal Genome Biology and Evolution, analysed the genetic material of people living in the region today, identifying DNA sequences inherited from Neanderthals. \"As far as human history goes, this area was the stepping stone for the peopling of all of Eurasia,\" said Omer Gokcumen, assistant professor at UB College of Arts and Sciences. \"This is where humans first settled when they left Africa. It may be where they first met Neanderthals. From the standpoint of genetics, it is a very interesting region,\" said Gokcumen. Scientists analysed 16 genomes belonging to people of Turkish descent. \"Within these genomes, the areas where we see relatively common Neanderthal introgression are in genes related to metabolism and immune system responses,\" said Recep Ozgur Taskent, a PhD candidate at UB. \"Broadly speaking, these are functions that can have an impact on health,\" said Taskent. For example, one DNA sequence that originated from Neanderthals includes a genetic variant linked to celiac disease. Another includes a variant tied to a lowered risk of malaria. The relations that our ancestors had with Neanderthals tens of thousands of years ago may continue to exert an influence on our well-being today, Gokcumen said. In addition to exploring the specific functions of genetic material that the Turkish population inherited from Neanderthals, the study also examined the Neanderthals influence on human populations in Western Asia more broadly. However, the research shows that people living in this area today have relatively little Neanderthal DNA compared to people in other parts of the world. The team analysed genomic data from dozens of Western Asian individuals and observed that, on average, with a few exceptions, these populations carry less Neanderthal DNA than Europeans, Central Asians and East Asians. The differences in Neanderthal ancestry between Western Asian and other populations may be due to the regions unique position in human history, Taskent added.','HOME-SCIENCE','','2017-10-25 19:54:00','PTI | Oct 25, 2017, 19:54 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:55'),(356,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/sugar-makes-cancer-tumours-more-aggressive-study/articleshow/61101358.cms','Sugar makes cancer tumours more aggressive: Study','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61101365,width-400,resizemode-4/61101365.jpg]','LONDON: Scientists have found that sugar awakens cancer cells and makes tumours more aggressive, according to a nine-year long research that is being hailed as a crucial breakthrough in cancer research. The research project conducted by Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven) and Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) in Belgium clarified how the Warburg effect, a phenomenon in which cancer cells rapidly break down sugars, stimulates tumour growth. The discovery provides evidence for a positive correlation between sugar and cancer, which may have far- reaching impacts on tailor-made diets for cancer patients. The projects focus was the Warburg effect, or the observation that tumours convert significantly higher amounts of sugar into lactate compared to healthy tissues. As one of the most prominent features of cancer cells, this phenomenon has been extensively studied and even used to detect brain tumours, among other applications. But so far, it has been unclear whether the effect is merely a symptom of cancer, or a cause. While earlier research into cancer cell metabolism focused on mapping out metabolic peculiarities, this study - published in the journal Nature Communications - clarifies the link between metabolic deviation and oncogenic potency in cancerous cells. \"Our research reveals how the hyperactive sugar consumption of cancerous cells leads to a vicious cycle of continued stimulation of cancer development and growth,\" said Johan Thevelein from VIB-KU Leuven. \"Thus, it is able to explain the correlation between the strength of the Warburg effect and tumour aggressiveness. This link between sugar and cancer has sweeping consequences,\" said Thevelein. \"Our results provide a foundation for future research in this domain, which can now be performed with a much more precise and relevant focus,\" he said. Yeast cell research was essential to the discovery, as these cells contain the same Ras proteins commonly found in tumour cells, which can cause cancer in mutated form. Using yeast as a model organism, researchers examined the connection between Ras activity and the highly active sugar metabolism in yeast. \"The main advantage of using yeast was that our research was not affected by the additional regulatory mechanisms of mammalian cells, which conceal crucial underlying processes,\" said Thevelein. \"We were thus able to target this process in yeast cells and confirm its presence in mammalian cells,\" he said.','HOME-SCIENCE','','2017-10-16 15:16:00','PTI | Oct 16, 2017, 15:16 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:56'),(357,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/new-nutrient-drink-may-ward-off-alzheimers-disease/articleshow/61362609.cms','New nutrient drink may ward off Alzheimers disease','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61362850,width-400,resizemode-4/61362850.jpg]','BOSTON: Scientists have developed a nutrient cocktail which may slow down cognitive impairment in the early stages of Alzheimers disease.

The mixture, Souvenaid, increases production of new synapses and restores connectivity between brain regions, improving memory and other cognitive functions, MIT Technology Review reported. Researchers mixed three naturally occurring dietary compounds: choline, uridine, and the omega-3 fatty acid DHA. \"All those compounds are taken simultaneously boost production of phosphatides, encouraging membrane development, which is critical in creating new synapses,\" researchers said.

Compared to people who drank the placebo, patients who drank Souvenaid throughout the trial showed less worsening in everyday cognitive and functional performance and significantly less atrophy of the hippocampus, which is caused early in Alzheimers by brain tissue loss. \"It feels like science-fiction, where you can take a drink of Souvenaid and you get more synapses for improved cognitive function.

Scientists at the University of Cambridge in the UK showed that far from being just background activity, the default mode network involved in daydreaming may be essential to helping us perform tasks on autopilot. The findings have relevance to brain injury, particularly following traumatic brain injury, where problems with memory and impulsivity can substantially compromise social reintegration. They may also have relevance for mental health disorders, such as addiction, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, where particular thought patterns drive repeated behaviours, and the mechanisms of anaesthetic agents and other drugs on the brain. Previously, scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine had found that a collection of brain regions appeared to be more active during such states of rest. This network was named the default mode network (DMN). While it has since been linked to, among other things, daydreaming, thinking about the past, planning for the future, and creativity, its precise function is unclear. In the new research published in the journal Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, scientists showed that the DMN plays an important role in allowing us to switch to autopilot once we are familiar with a task. In the study, 28 volunteers took part in a task while lying inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Functional MRI (fMRI) measures changes in brain oxygen levels as a proxy for neural activity. Participants were shown four cards and asked to match a target card to one of these cards. There were three possible rules - matching by colour, shape or number. Volunteers were not told the rule, but rather had to work it out for themselves through trial and error. The most interesting differences in brain activity occurred when comparing the two stages of the task - acquisition (where the participants were learning the rules by trial and error) and application (where the participants had learned the rule and were now applying it). During the acquisition stage, the dorsal attention network, which has been associated with the processing of attention-demanding information, was more active. However, in the application stage, where participants utilised learned rules from memory, the DMN was more active. In this stage, the stronger the relationship between activity in the DMN and in regions of the brain associated with memory, such as the hippocampus, the faster and more accurately the volunteer was able to perform the task. This suggested that during the application stage, the participants could efficiently respond to the task using the rule from memory. \"Rather than waiting passively for things to happen to us, we are constantly trying to predict the environment around us,\" said Deniz Vatansever, former student at the University of Cambridge. \"Our evidence suggests it is the default mode network that enables us do this. It is essentially like an autopilot that helps us make fast decisions when we know what the rules of the environment are,\" said Vatansever, who is now based at the University of York. \"So for example, when you are driving to work in the morning along a familiar route, the default mode network will be active, enabling us to perform our task without having to invest lots of time and energy into every decision,\" he said.','HOME-SCIENCE','','2017-10-24 14:52:00','PTI | Oct 24, 2017, 14:52 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:57'),(359,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/corals-developing-taste-for-plastics-study/articleshow/61223346.cms','Corals developing taste for plastics: Study','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61223346,width-400,resizemode-4/61223346.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Corals may have developed a preference for consuming plastic bits, putting them at risk of being choked by the indigestible materials, a study has found. Scientists have long known that marine animals mistakenly eat plastic debris because the tiny bits of floating plastic might look like prey. The study of plastic ingestion by corals by researchers from Duke University in the US suggests there may be an additional reason for the potentially harmful behaviour. Visual cues, such as a resemblance to prey, do not factor into the appeal because corals have no eyes, researchers said. \"Corals in our experiments ate all types of plastics but preferred unfouled microplastics by a threefold difference over microplastics covered in bacteria,\" said Austin S Allen, a PhD student at Dukes Nicholas School of the Environment. \"This suggests the plastic itself contains something that makes it tasty,\" said Allen. \"When plastic comes from the factory, it has hundreds of chemical additives on it. Any one of these chemicals or a combination of them could be acting as a stimulant that makes plastic appealing to corals,\" said Alexander C Seymour, from Dukes Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Center. Further research will be needed to identify the specific additives that make the plastic so tasty to corals and determine if the same chemicals act as feeding stimulants to other marine species, researchers said. Microplastics, tiny pieces of weathered plastic less than five millimetres in diameter, began accumulating in the oceans four decades ago and are now ubiquitous in the marine environment. They pose a major threat to foraging sea animals, including many species of birds, turtles, fish, marine mammals and invertebrates. Since plastic is largely indigestible, it can lead to intestinal blockages, create a false sense of fullness or reduce energy reserves in animals that consume it. \"About eight per cent of the plastic that coral polyps in our study ingested was still stuck in their guts after 24 hours,\" said Allen. The biological effects of most of these compounds are still unknown, but some, such as phthalates, are confirmed environmental estrogens and androgens - hormones that affect sex determination. Researchers conducted their two-part study using corals collected from waters off the North Carolina coast. In their first experiment, they offered small amounts of eight different types of microplastics to the corals to see if the animals would eat the bite-sized bits versus other similarly-sized items offered to them, such as clean sand. \"We found that the corals ate all of the plastic types we offered and mostly ignored sand,\" Allen said. In the second experiment, they put groups of coral into separate feeding chambers. Each group was offered the same amount weathered plastics for a 30-minute period. Some groups got only particles of unfouled microplastics while others got only particles of weathered microplastics fouled with a bacterial biofilm. This experiment verified that the corals would eat both types of plastic, but preferred the clean type by a three-to- one margin. The researchers hope their findings will encourage scientists to explore the role taste plays in determining why marine organisms ingest microplastics.','HOME-SCIENCE','','2017-10-25 16:25:00','PTI | Oct 25, 2017, 16:25 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:58'),(360,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/mars-has-twisted-magnetic-tail-scientists/articleshow/61168634.cms','Mars has twisted magnetic ‘tail’: Scientists','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61168633,width-400,resizemode-4/61168633.jpg]','JAIPUR: Nasas MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission) spacecraft, which has been orbiting Mars since 2014, has been gathering data that will allow scientists to understand changes in the upper atmosphere of the Red Planet.

What Mars now has is a thin atmosphere - and even this is at risk, say scientists who have discovered that the planet has a twisted tail. The process that created this tail could also allow some of Mars already thin atmosphere to escape to space, researchers said on science news website Science Daily. At a press briefing on October 19 at Utah during the annual meeting of the America Astronomical Societys Division for Planetary Sciences, Gina DiBraccio of Nasas Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland, said, \"We found that Mars magnetic tail, or magnetotail, is unique in the solar system. Its not like the magnetotail found at Venus, a planet with no magnetic field of its own, nor is it like Earths, which is surrounded by its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, it is a hybrid between the two.\" Science Daily reported: \"The team found that a process called \"magnetic reconnection\" must have a big role in creating the Martian magnetotail because, if reconnection were occurring, it would put the twist in the tail.\" A model the scientists built suggested that such reconnection would cause the planets tail to twist 45 degrees from what is expected, based on the direction of the magnetic field carried by the solar wind, the scientist explained. The model was found to be in agreement with readings based on MAVEN data. \"Mars lost its global magnetic field billions of years ago and now just has remnant fossil magnetic fields embedded in certain regions of its surface. According to the new work, Mars magnetotail is formed when magnetic fields carried by the solar wind join with the magnetic fields embedded in the Martian surface in a process called magnetic reconnection. The solar wind is a stream of electrically conducting gas continuously blowing from the Suns surface into space at about one million miles (1.6 million kilometers) per hour. It carries magnetic fields from the Sun with it. If the solar wind field happens to be oriented in the opposite direction to a field in the Martian surface, the two fields join together in magnetic reconnection,\" Science Daily explained, adding that such reconnection might propel some of the atmosphere of Mars into space. Mars upper atmosphere has electrically charged particles (ions), which respond to electric and magnetic forces and flow along magnetic field lines, the website explained. \"Since the Martian magnetotail is formed by linking surface magnetic fields to solar wind fields, ions in the Martian upper atmosphere have a pathway to space if they flow down the magnetotail. Like a stretched rubber band suddenly snapping to a new shape, magnetic reconnection also releases energy, which could actively propel ions in the Martian atmosphere down the magnetotail into space.\" The website said magnetic fields are invisible but their direction and strength can be measured by the magnetometer instrument on MAVEN.','HOME-SCIENCE','Rosamma Thomas','2017-10-22 07:48:00','| TNN | Oct 22, 2017, 07:48 IST','2017-12-16 19:17:58'),(361,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/hybrid-solar-systems-to-be-installed-in-govt-schools-of-haryana/articleshow/62090351.cms','Hybrid solar systems to be installed in government schools of Haryana','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62092782,width-400,resizemode-4/62092782.jpg]','CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government has decided to install hybrid solar systems in all government schools of the state in a phased manner.

Moreover, any amount which is left after installation of hybrid solar systems in all the government schools and receipt of central assistance would be used for operations and maintenance, upgrading and replacement of consumer items (battery) considering the fact that the solar panel would have a warranty period of 25 years and the power conditioning unit (PCU) and batteries would have a warranty of five years after successful commissioning, he added.','CITY-CHANDIGARH','','2017-12-16 10:04:00','TNN | Dec 16, 2017, 10:04 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:00'),(362,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/haryana-ag-office-launches-project-to-curb-unnecessary-appearances-of-investigating-officers-before-hc/articleshow/62090379.cms','Haryana AG office launches project to curb unnecessary appearances of investigating officers before HC','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62092750,width-400,resizemode-4/62092750.jpg]','CHANDIGARH: The office of Haryana advocate general (AG) has launched a pilot project to cut down on the number of personal appearances of the investigating officers (IOs) before the Punjab and Haryana High Court in criminal cases. Initially, Sector 20 police station of Panchkula has been identified to launch the project. After its successful implementation, the same would be replicated at other police stations in the entire state. This is the third information, communication and technology (ICT) enabled initiative from the AG office that would help in reducing the number of personal appearances of around 50,000 IOs per year in the High Court in criminal cases. Haryana AG B R Mahajan said his office is keen to use the technologies in routine work to save time and money of the court and the state government. The new project has been designed to curb unnecessary appearances of IOs in the court. At the same time, this would help in reducing delay in the disposal of cases. It would also cause less inconvenience to police and law officers as well as reduce the financial burden on the state exchequer, he added. Officials of the AG office said personal appearance of the IO would be required only in those cases where original police file of the case will be required. Also in cases where the HC has passed specific orders, they would be asked to appear. At present, IOs had to furnish particulars of a criminal case in a prescribed proforma before appearing in the court. This proforma is being used by the law officers as well as IOs to make the required information readily available at the hearing. Now, the concerned Naib Court or MHC or data entry operator would have to furnish details of the case in this proforma and forward the same to the AG office through Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS). This would not only facilitate the law officers in the cases but would also bring down the number of unnecessary appearance of IOs. A team of 13 officers under the supervision of deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Panchkula and an assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Panchkula, have been selected to successfully implement this project. Two law officers posted at the AG office have also been associated with the project.','CITY-CHANDIGARH','','2017-12-16 09:58:00','TNN | Dec 16, 2017, 09:58 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:00'),(363,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/paper-leak-retrieve-phone-messages-sent-from-exam-centre-hc-tells-panchkula-dcp/articleshow/62090385.cms','Paper leak: Retrieve phone messages sent from exam centre, HC tells Panchkula DCP','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62092635,width-400,resizemode-4/62092635.jpg]','CHANDIGARH:The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Panchkula deputy commissioner of police (DCP) to involve the state police cybercrime cell to retrieve messages from phone used allegedly to send the question paper for selection exam of assistant professors (Hindi) in Haryana outside the examination centre in Panchkula. Directions have also been issued to the police to make serious efforts to arrest one more person who was allegedly involved in the leakage of paper.

The court was also informed that the principal of the school, where the paper was allegedly leaked, has specifically stated that on the phone caught from one Sandeep, he was seen to have sent a \"Whatsapp\" message to someone, containing a photograph of the question paper. On the petitioners plea for CBI probe, the HC refused to accept it, observing that the matter is still under investigation with police. The matter had reached before the HC in the wake of the petition filed by Rajeev Kumar, a resident of Bhiwani, and several other candidates who had participated in the selection process. The main allegation in the petition was that during the examination on February 26, 2016, several candidates who entered the examination centre at Doon School in Panchkula were not checked properly and one person was later found using a mobile phone in which he was sending the questions on WhatsApp to a paper solver.

While adviser (civil aviation) Ashok Sangwan signed the MOU on behalf of Haryana, head of business management Anil Kumar Gupta was the AAI signatory. The development has taken place after detailed study of various projects or models in the country and the impact on grass root development of the Rohtak-Hisar-Sirsa region by 2030. A spokesman of the Haryana civil aviation department said Hisar had been notified by the Union government in Bharat Mala Project with exciting possibilities for a Delhi-Sirsa Economic Corridor and connection to Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) via the Rohtak-Rewari link. The corridor has potential to emerge as an economic enabler for the region and would completely transform the region in years to come. The international aviation hub is proposed to be developed around the existing civil airstrip at Hisar, he added. The spokesman said the state has already reserved 4,200 acres of land adjoining the pre-existing airstrip, to be utilized for the project. The proposed aviation hub envisages a 9,000-feet runway with an airport matching international standards, ample parking for airlines and general aviation (GA) operators, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities, aerospace university, global training centre for pilots, engineers and ground handling staff and residential and commercial development. He said the department has pitched with airline operators for sub-basing of their aircraft at Hisar for night parking and routine maintenance. The operators have shown keen interest in the proposal, he added. The construction of a large apron, small passenger terminal and three hangars to accommodate A320 type of aircraft are being expedited for implementation of UDAN II from the upgraded Hisar airport in the interim. A joint working group comprising of domain experts has been constituted to guide the state government in developing the hub.

While passing the orders, a division bench headed by Justice Surya Kant has asked the SIT to file a status report of the case in a sealed cover on January 31. The bench, however, made it clear that the SIT would report to the HC directly. The court order has come a day after the Raj Jit Singh moved the HC seeking directions to hand over the investigation of FIR number 1, registered on June 12, 2017, related to drug case to some officer other than Harpreet Singh Sidhu, head of special task force (STF). In his plea, Raj Jit had expressed strong apprehensions of being falsely implicated by Sidhu, who has a personal grudge against him. On Thursday, the HC had asked the Punjab government to come with a panel of officers who can be asked to probe the case. The court had also asked the advocate general (AG) Punjab to share the names of officers with senior advocate Anupam Gupta. When the matter came up for hearing on Friday, Punjab AG Atul Nanda submitted a panel of six IPS officers — Gaurav Yadav, Prabodh Kumar, R N Dhoke, Sudhanshu Srivastava, Praveen K Sinha and Kunwar Vijay Pratap. The AG, however, had not shared the names with Anupam Gupta, who is representing directorate of enforcement (ED) officer Niranjan Singh in the matter. Gupta also submitted a list of three officers — S Chattopadhyaya, Prabodh Kumar and Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh — for the SIT. Though Chattopadhyayas name was not in the AG list, Gupta termed him an officer of outstanding record, especially in handling the situation during terrorism in the state.

Without elaborating on the reasons behind the delay in issuance of the notification to bring down the cost of power for the industry from existing Rs 6.12-Rs 7.39 per unit to Rs 5 per unit, the minister said chief minister Amarinder Singh is keen on implementing the proposal. He also assured the project would be introduced soon. According to the sources in the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), offering electricity at Rs 5 per unit to the industry, along with other subsidies being offered in the state, would increase the annual subsidy bill of the government to over Rs 13,000 crore. The subsidy to be given to the industrialists would add around Rs 2,800 crore to this bill. Sources also said the cash-strapped state government, which was struggling to meet the routine expenditure, especially after the implementation of the GST, was finding it hard to divert funds to meet the increased subsidy bill. In fact, this was being perceived to be a major reason behind the delay. Playing down the latest report brought out by the Chandigarh-based research body Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) in which it has been stated that around 81.52% farmers receiving free electricity were from the medium and large categories and only 18.48% were small and marginal farmers, holding land of 5 acres or less, the power minister said Punjab farmers needed subsidised power irrespective of their landholdings as the input cost for agriculture has increased over the years. \"There are no plans to end the power subsidies to the state farmers,\" the minister, who was at Rajpura near Patiala, said. Expressing concerns over the huge debt of PSPCL, which has crossed Rs 31,000 crore, Gurjit said it was quite unfortunate that they had inherited a debt burden from the SAD-BJP government.

While addressing the gathering, the minister hailed the initiative. He said that more such projects should be set up across the state to enable farmers to earn money while crop residue gets converted into fuel. He said pellet making units could help bring down the number of instances of stubble burning and generate additional income for the farmers. Aston Universitys Professor Robert Berry and his team of experts highlighted how the agri waste could be used for generating energy. He said use of such technology could benefit the local farming community and have huge economic and environmental impact as well. He said promoted under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme of the thermal plant, the project was likely to provide a sustainable business model that could be replicated at the village level. He said the project would unlock the value of crop waste and realize its potential in supplementing farm income. He said paddy crop generated around 2.4 tonnes of straw per acre and an equal quantity of pellets could be produced by compressing them in a pelletizer. Other than reducing the biomass volume of the straw by over 2.5 times, it also makes the straw easier to store, transport and use as fuel, he said.

The Jewish community in the city will be celebrating the festival of lights till December 20. The eight-day-long Jewish festival began by lighting the first candle of Hanukkiah on Tuesday evening. A prominent member of the Jewish community, Ezra Moses, said, \"The main part of the celebration is the lighting of the Hanukkiah candle, which has nine candles in it— in the synagogue as well as at individual homes. We light one lamp along with the central head candle on each of the eight days. By the end of the week, all nine candles are lit.\" \"We spend the rest of the days in prayer and by feasting on sweets like halwas, doughnuts, custard and exchanging gifts. Some families even play games with dreidels and sing festive songs,\" he added. Speaking about the significance of the festival Moses, added, \"Over 3,000 years ago, the Romans had adulterated the pure olive oil used by the Jewish community in the synagogue in an attempt to force them to worship the king and other idols. The Jews found enough pure olive oil to burn their holy lamps for a day. This light, however, miraculously kept burning for eight days. The festival of lights commemorates this miracle that strengthened the faith of the community in our one God.\" While this is one of the two biggest festivals for the Jewish community across the world, it has a special significance for the community here as it marks the 138th anniversary of the only synagogue in the city \"With a population of 1,800 Jews, Thane has around 40% of the countrys Jewish community and the Gate of Heaven Synagogue was inaugurated during this festival over a century ago, which makes it special for us.

At a recently-held brainstorming session with senior officials from TMC, municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal had proposed to incentivise clean wards. According to the plan, 10 top corporators undertaking exemplary work in ensuring cleanliness in the area will get Rs 25 lakh more in addition to the existing annual ward improvement fund. There are 131 corporators spread across 33 wards in the city, who are paid an annual sum of Rs 25lakh to undertake various developmental works in their respective areas. The decision by the commisioner is likely to add Rs 2.5 crore to the excercise that has now drawn the ire of activists. \"We are working on ensuring cleanliness in the city and plan to involve corporators in percolating the message of cleanliness in their respective areas. We will be rewarding corporators with an increase in ward improvement funds as an encouragement,\" said Jaiswal. The selection of the top 10 corporators will be done following the initiatives taken along with the results seen in the respective wards. The idea is to involve micro level participation of the elected representatives who can reach out the message of cleanliness door-to-door in their respective strongholds, explained a senior civic official. It may be recalled that the city had secured a dismal ranking on the nationwide cleanliness rating since the last two years causing massive embarrassment for the civic administration. The civic body has been claiming to be planning and executing cleanliness campaigns, but activists lamented that there is little improvement seen in the wards prompting this initiative. BJP corporator Narayan Pawar lashed out at the administration for offloading its work on the elected representatives. \"What is the TMC here for if all the work is either to be done by citizens or corporators? This is a ridiculous concept and the commisioner should instead keep a reward for its staff for doing their job properly,\" said Pawar. An activist said that the civic body is spending a fortune on paying the conservancy staff but very precious little is achieved through it. \"Why is the civic body trying to further strain the civic treasury by adding Rs 2.5 crore expense by incentivising corporators for such initiatives,\" he lamented.

A Class XII student of science from St Xaviers College, Mumbai, the bespectacled teen left home on Monday as usual to attend college, but landed up in Matheran. En route, he withdrew Rs 500 from an ATM and presumably threw away a bag containing his belongings and switched off his cellphone. \"Initially, when the family reported him missing, we registered akidnapping case as he was a minor. We made inquiries. One witness confirmed seeing the lad with a college bag taking a Karjatbound train. We also spotted him at the station in CCTV images, but when we saw footage at Matheran there was no bag...he had switched off his phone and though his fathers phone was linked with his, the location was untraceable,\" said Ravikant Malekar, senior inspector from Wagle Estate police station. Locals in Matheran identified him. The last person to see him was a woman. \"She saw him standing alone and had barely walked away when suddenly there was an uproar from the monkeys...the body was found 600 feet down at Battle Skip Point which is in the middle of Garbett Point,\" the officer said. The post-mortem indicated a cardiac arrest; there were multiple fractures too. Officials said the teen, who had a talent for drawing and creative designing, was fond of Matheran and had been there many times with his family. His father is a businessman and mother a housewife; he was the only child. Classmates had described him as an introvert. \"They said he seemed upset over the past few weeks and did not interact much. He didnt even pay much attention in lectures and used to draw sketches in his book. He had not been to college also since the past one week as he was not feeling well,\" said Malekar. An official from St Xaviers College said Daga had never been a problem for the college. He had certain difficulties in learning, so he was enrolled with the inclusion cell on the campus, said the official. Though he was offered support for exams and study material, he never used them. On Tuesday, when it was reported that he was missing, a song Teri Meri Kahani was dedicated to him during a singing contest in the ongoing socials. On Wednesday, the college counselled his classmates as they were all shaken by the news of his death. \"It was essential as they are all preparing for their boards,\" said the official.

The plan will not just clear the mess around the tracks but also make it visually appealing for passengers crossing the stretch just like the experiment paid off in the city like the one at Pokhran 1, said officials. A proposal will soon be readied for revamping the walls of houses and walls skirting the tracks along the Thane and Diva slow and fast stretch. As per the plans, the paint a wall concept that was taken up along several roads in the city early this year will now be replicated, but on walls along the tracks with residents and artists contributing collectively to liven up the stretch with murals or theme paintings. Experts and artists will be roped in to recreate pre-approved designs on the otherwise mundane looking walls of the houses and concrete boundaries. The civic body is likely to fund the expense incurred in the initiative, said officials. \"We want to give an identity to the areas and give a feel good look to passengers crossing the stretches. Presently, the areas are strewn with garbage giving a repulsive feel to commuters who should instead be given an opportunity to admire the city,\" said an official.

The special squad, which has been active for the last four days has penalized around 425 rickshaw drivers and collected a fine amount of over Rs 70,000 from them.

Some dont want to ply on short distance route, others turn down long-distance passengers and some have given a go-by to the RTO-approved tariff and dictate their fare to the needy passengers.

You dont have to bowl (just) as a part-time bowler. You need to take the responsibility with the ball or bat,\" Jadhav said. \"I guess when you play for India, you have to contribute in every possible way you can. While playing in the IPL, I do that with wicketkeeping -- by contributing rather than batting,\" Jadhav said. Jadhav said he varies his action according the batsman so as to make it difficult to read. \"Its both - a bit of my action and the pace I vary according to the batsmen that makes it difficult (for them) to read I guess. Mahi bhai asked me to bowl. Obviously, Mahi wants a few bowlers from the top five or six batsmen to bowl at least 4-5 overs. If a bowler has a bad day, it helps (the team) you know.\" Jadhav who got out for a duck in the fourth ODI in Ranchi is yet to click as a batsman and he said hes to learn quickly. Youngster Manish Pandey too is missing among runs and Jadhav said they would have to get into their act soon. \"Obviously, the opportunity has been missed, especially in the last game. But its still early stages for Manish (Pandey) and me. We need to grab whatever opportunity is thrown at us. We need to learn quickly from the opportunities we have missed.

Its my strength. If a spinner is bowling to my pads in the middle overs and when you dont wanna take too many high-risk shots. \"Thats the shot which you can take when the bowler tries to bowl outside the leg stump or off stump. You can paddle it out because we have 4 fielders on the leg side and behind the square, you have only one (fielder). If you pass that fielder, you get a sure-shot boundary. Its a good shot to play when the bowlers attack my pads.\" Jadhav also backed their batting unit which looks too much dependent on Virat Kohli. \"Virat is a great player and its always nice if he scores.

Williamson said the Kiwi batsmen did not justify to lose eight wickets for just 16 runs. \"Thats whats so frustrating, because we failed as a batting unit. The spinners of the Indian side bowled very well but I dont think it is justified to lose 8 wickets for 16 runs. We need to look at some of our plans. There was turn in the pitch in some other games too but we were able to handle it better then,\" Williamson said after their massive 190-run defeat in the fifth and final ODI. \"Unfortunately, sometimes the biggest, brightest lessons come from failures and defeats. I certainly hope to learn from here. It was extremely a good effort to take it to the fifth ODI but sitting here after all that, its frustrating. The better team certainly won today. \"We certainly werent good today. No excuses. India were just the better side. They were consistent throughout the series,\" he added. Ranked ahead of India by one rung, world no. 3 New Zealand showed resilience to bounce back after a 0-3 whitewash in the Test series as they had leveled the five-match ODI rubber 2-2 with a 19-run win in Ranchi. \"Yeah, its extremely disappointing. You know, after a tough Test series to bounce back and show the heart that was required, the fight that we needed to go 2-all against a very good Indian side, was a superb effort,\" Williamson said. \"They got above-par initially with the bat on a tough surface. There are certainly no excuses from our end, we were extremely poor with the bat today,\" he said. A win would have been made history for the Black Caps, who have never beaten India at home earlier in four contests. The Kiwi skipper said its all about regrouping after going back home when they host Pakistan for two Tests before a packed ODI calendar involving Australia, Bangladesh, South Africa and the Champions Trophy in June next year. \"Yeah, its tough to say at the moment. Were going to go back home and play in very different conditions. At the moment we want to reflect on our performance here. We were somewhat disappointing, barring a couple of games. We want to be showing steps of improvement everyday,\" Williamson said. He further credited India for setting up a challenging 270-run target on a tough batting surface at the Dr YSR ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium here. \"Ideally we wouldve liked to have restricted them to much less. The way the put together partnerships on a pitch that was slow was a very good effort. They kept going at 5 runs an over on this pitch, they certainly deserved to win today. They were fantastic,\" he said. Opener Rohit Sharma returned among runs with a fine 70, while an ever-consistent Virat Kohli slammed 65 before Mahendra Singh Dhoni (41), Kedar Jadhav (39 not out) contributed to take India to 269 for six after electing to bat. \"They had a good score on the board on that surface, but we knew that if we could get partnerships together, who knows, we couldve done better,\" Williamson said. Despite the losses, Williamson pointed out at the positives they would take home from tour. \"He (Mitchell Santner) has been outstanding. Certainly a highlight from our tour. A young cricketer, who is newish to our side. Although conditions were favourable to spinners here there are a lot of spinners who come here and struggle. \"I guess its because of the pace of the wicket against extremely good players of spin. Mitch (Santner) has performed day in and day out. Hes a great asset to have. Not to mention his batting and his fielding as well. Look forward to seeing his progression in the future, he said. \"I think Tom Latham was outstanding. We need to take those little good bits and look at someone like Virat (Kohli).\" Ross Taylor has had a forgetful outing not only with his bat but with his fielding as well but Williamson came out in defence of the senior batsman. \"I think if you look at any winning performance, there are one or two significant performances. If you look at the India side, theres Virat (Kohli). I think pretty much every game he made significant contributions for his side. Sometimes the conditions werent ideal to play on but someone has to step up and whoever that person is, we need a lot more,\" he said. Williamson was New Zealands top-scorer of the day with 27 before being dismissed by an expansive inside-out shot that triggered the collapse. \"It is a tough one. You feel like its a good option to play that shot and if you get out, you question it. Here I am questioning it,\" he said. \"For Ross (Taylor) and I to take it deeper, it wouldve been a lot better for our cause. Obviously, it wasnt happening for us today. We both got dismissed when we needed at least one of us to hang in there and take the game deep.\" He also praised Indian spinner Amit Mishras match-winning performance both in the decider and the series. \"To get fifer for any bowler on any surface is a significant performance. He (Mishra) bowled very well today. I think its justified in him getting the man-of-the-match and the man-of-the-series. He has been very consistent.

Its a pretty exciting time. Hopefully we can get better than what we have in the past,\" the former New Zealand captain told the New Zealand Cricket website as they checked into the coastal Andhra city this evening. New Zealand have never won a bilateral ODI series against India in India. It is in sharp contrast to their 18-11 record in India in a multi-team tournament. But having defeated India by 19 runs in Ranchi yesterday, Kane Williamson and Co are determined to return home on a high after being on the road since the Zimbabwe tour in July. \"Four months on the road becomes tough but going into a decider its pretty easy to get up for.

Terming India outstanding at home he said: \"Hopefully we can continue the progress we have made in the last couple of games. Hopefully we can replicate our performance in three days time.\" Williamson read the conditions beautifully in Ranchi to opt to bat as Martin Guptills 72 took them to 260/7 which proved to be a winning total on a difficult Ranchi wicket. \"It was a pretty tough wicket. Martin and Latham got us to a good start. Once the ball got softer, it showed how tough it was to rotate the strike. \"Kane was struggling out there as well. But we were always confident to defend 260. We picked up crucial wickets along the way. Happy with the result. Going into the match with six bowlers gave Kane a bit of leeway with the bowling changes. It was pretty tough once the ball got a bit older. But we knew we had to keep wickets in hand. It was never going to be easy to score 80 or 90 in the last 10.\" Winter may have already set in Ranchi, but surprisingly there was no dew yesterday. \"We were fortunate that there was no dew out there.

The excitement in the group is very high,\" the New Zealand pacer said on the eve of the series decider. India-New Zealand bilateral rivalry dates back to 1988 when the Dilip Vengsarkar-led team made a clean 4-0 sweep against John Wright and Co. In 1995, Mohammad Azharuddins Indian team won 3-2, and four years later a Sachin Tendulkar-led team produced an identical result. Their worst defeat has been in 2010 when Gautam Gambhir led India to a 5-0 rout against Ross Taylor and Co. \"Everyone is really looking forward to tomorrow. Its been a long tour for some guys and itll be nice to finish whats been a tough tour on a high note. The spirits are high and everyone is excited about the challenge for tomorrow,\" Southee added. The biggest takeaway from their 19-run Ranchi win was Kane Williamsons assessment to read the conditions perfectly as the Kiwi skipper not only opted to bowl ignoring the dew but picked three spinners on a surface that surprisingly behaved slow. \"I think its just the communication. From the batters spent some town in the middle and what they find tough they feed that information to the bowlers,\" Southee explained the reason. \"If we bowl we give information to batsman. Not every time we can get it right. Just give ourselves the best chance to read the conditions and adapt quickly.\" Asked about their assessment of the Visakhapatnam wicket, he said they are confident to take a horses for courses approach. \"Kane and (coach) Mike will look at the wicket and theyll come up with the best side they think suited for the wicket,\" he said about the surface that has seen Indias monumental 356/9 against Pakistan in the venues first ODI in 2005. \"Weve chopped and changed throughout the series. The pitches have changed in each game. So I guess itll be whatever we think the best mix is for this game.\" He further said exciting time lies ahead for the New Zealand ODI side with their three allrounders James Neesham, Mitchell Santner and Corey Anderson young and learning the tricks of the trade. \"Theyre all very young and still learning the game and so I think its exciting in the years to come with those three guys all in their early to mid-20s with big future ahead of them. I dont think its a worry at all, its one of their strengths going forward over the next possible 10 years, well have three guys fighting out keeping each other on their toes.\" Indias win in Dharamsala and Mohali had Kohli written all over it as the star batsman steered the chase with his unbeaten knocks. \"Hes a quality player especially when India is chasing, his record chasing is phenomenal. Hes obviously a big wicket when any side plays against India. Him and Dhoni theyre records are unbelievable. Southee said its not just Kohli but the others also pose an equal threat. \"We have to keep taking wickets. They got quality players in and around those two.

Manish Pandey and Kedar Jadhav have been assigned that role now and neither of them have played long enough in those positions to succeed consistently. They are also by-products of the IPL era where they are required to play the big shots. Pandey perished trying to do that on Wednesday while Jadhav perished attempting a cute stroke at the Kotla. Ditto for Hardik Pandya. What the finishers of the past, named above, benefitted from was a crack opening pair in either Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly or Ganguly and Sehwag, or Sehwag and Tendulkar, who invariably got the team off to sublime starts. Pandey and Jadhav have not enjoyed that luxury. They have also been a bit crippled by the fact that the skippers hitting skills and the ability to rotate strike on difficult pitches have been on the wane over the last 18 months. In Mohali, when he scored 80, Dhoni had good allies in the form of a true pitch and a red-hot Virat Kohli. Kohlis skill to find the gaps consistently enabled Dhoni to create his own tempo and rhythm and play a key role in the win. In Ranchi, on a tired pitch, and with Kohli gone and the game still in balance, he had to make all the play on his own. As his 11 off 31 balls illustrated, he wasnt equipped to do it. Ajinkya Rahane batted well for his 57, but he is not the batsman that can take you home. Not yet anyway. He has hardly batted beyond the 35th over, barring the odd knock. While Dhoni will go down in history as one of Indias and the games greatest ever middle-order players, he is right now in the need of support when it comes to injecting momentum in chases. At 30 or 32, one could hope for stirring solos from him. Without Suresh Raina or Yuvraj Singh and without a solid and in-form top-order, those solos wont happen. It was proved in Sydney where Dhoni fed off Pandey (104* off 81 balls) to score 34 off 42 balls as India chased down 331. In Kanpur last year, against South Africa, Rohit Sharma slammed a sublime 150 and till he was there Dhoni did not feel troubled. But the moment Rohit departed with India needing 34 from 23 balls, Dhoni struggled. ALL SET FOR DECIDER: India and New Zealand have been tied 2-2 twice in the past in five-match series. In 1995, India managed to win the final ODI at the Brabourne Stadium to clinch the series under Mohammad Azharuddin. In 1999, Tendulkar led India to a series win in the fifth ODI at the Kotla. PROBLEM AREAS FOR INDIA UNDER-PERFORMING TOP-ORDER: Since 2013, very rarely have India not got good starts. In the four ODIs here, Indias starts have been 49, 21, 13 and 19. Rohit Sharma is yet to cross 15 in the four ODIs and he is one of Indias key players. His lack of form has put Kohli and Dhoni under pressure. IN-EXPERIENCED MIDDLE-ORDER: Axar Patel, Manish Pandey, Hardik Pandya and Kedar Jadhav may have played the odd great knock, but they havent been in the trenches fighting for the side and rescuing the team from tough situations enough number of times. With Raina (unwell) or Yuvraj (ignored), the team lacks experience in tight scenarios. PROFLIGATE BOWLING: India have so far bowled 30 wides in the series which is five extra overs. Umesh Yadav has contributed to 11 of those. In the absence of Shami, he was expected to lead the attack, but inconsistency has been his trusted friend and has always been reluctant to leave his company. AXARS ROLE: When Dhoni was asked about Mumbai all-rounder Abhishek Nayar during the 2009 Champions Trophy, he has snidely remarked, I dont know whether he is a batsman who could bowl or a bowler who could bat. Axar Patel, who has enjoyed the trust of the skipper falls in the same boat too as he has not inspired with the bat or ball, barring the last game in Ranchi where he scored 38.','SPORTS-NEW-ZEALAND-IN-INDIA-2016','','2016-10-28 08:49:00','TNN | Updated: Oct 28, 2016, 08:49 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:21'),(399,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/new-zealand-in-india-2016/top-stories/Dhoni-describes-bowlers-performance-as-one-of-the-best/articleshow/55133558.cms','Dhoni describes bowlers performance as one of the best','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-55133549,width-400,resizemode-4/55133549.jpg]','VISAKHAPATNAM: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni lavished praise on his bowlers for the resounding series-clinching win over New Zealand in the fifth and final ODI, describing the effort as \"one of the best performances by the bowlers\". Legspinner Amit Mishra produced a magical spell to claim 5 for 18 as India clinched the five-match ODI series 3-2 with a thumping 190-run victory in the final game. It was a perfect Diwali gift for the Indian cricket fans as Mahendra Singh Dhonis men carried the demolition job in style as the spinners made Black Caps succumbed to their lowest-ever total against India in ODIs. \"It was one of the best performances by the bowlers. This was one game where the spinners bowled with a lot of assistance. Before this when we bowled first, the wicket was always better to bat in the first half. It was an exceptional performance as there was a bit of dew. The pace at which the spinners bowled was perfect,\" Dhoni said at the post-match presentation ceremony. \"Mishras beauty is he bowls slow, so as a keeper you have time to recover. And in tandem with Axar (Patel), who bowls flat and quick, it was very good.\" Dhoni also hailed his deputy Virat Kohli for his 76-ball 65-run knock, which according to him set the platform for the 269 for six on a difficult wicket. \"I think Virat (Kohli) was superb with the bat. We got off to a decent start. When Rohit (Sharma) got injured, the message was if you think you cant carry on, just play your shots. Once he (Kohli) got out, Rohit gave us some momentum. We felt it was a difficult wicket to freely rotate. Thats when we decided to play the big shots. We felt 270 was par-plus but considering the dew factor that was necessary,\" he said. Dhoni said the five-match series provided the Indian team management the perfect platform to test some youngsters. \"Glad that we could rest some key players, with some big Test series coming up. I feel the batsmen down the order like Kedar Jadhav, Axar Patel and Manish Pandey gained a lot of experience. \"It is difficult to get the complete product in international cricket so the new players should be given time to develop,\" he said. New Zealand captain Kane Williamson termed their todays performance as \"terrible\". \"Without a doubt the total was a lot above par. India have played really well throughout the series. Its very hard to look past todays performance for us, you expect to put up a good performance whether we win or lose and today we were terrible,\" Williamson said. \"We expect a lot more of our batting, and losing 8 for 20 or whatever it is unacceptable. Playing against one of the best sides in the world, there is room to learn. A lot comes on the back of losses, so tough lessons. But its important we take them in. The disappointment is very fresh after a performance like this though. The Test series was extremely tough, coming into this one-day series, after heavy defeats, we fought hard in some tricky surfaces. That was a good effort,\" said Williamson. \"We pride ourselves on learning game to game, and today we didnt show that. There were number of individuals who did their reputations good. Someone like Tom Latham with the bat and Mitchell Santners all round work,\" he added. Mishra, who was adjudged man-of-the-match as well as man-of-the-series for his tally of 15 wickets at an average of 14.33, credited Dhoni for his stupendous show with the ball today. \"Its great for the team if I perform like this, theyve supported me during tough phases. At the start, I was a little tense, but Dhoni told me to calm down, bowl at the wickets, and thanks to that, all went well,\" he said. \"There was bounce and spin in the pitch, so bowling slowly, bowling normally worked for me. (India coach) Anil Kumble also talked to me about it before the match, to trust my strength, to trust the flighted balls. \"Axar Patel has also been doing well, and if newcomers keep doing well like this, it will be good for India. Very happy with the way I am bowling, hopefully I can continue,\" he said.','SPORTS-NEW-ZEALAND-IN-INDIA-2016','','2016-10-29 21:27:00','PTI | Oct 29, 2016, 21:27 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:23'),(400,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/new-zealand-in-india-2016/top-stories/India-v-New-Zealand-5th-ODI-Vizag-Under-fire-Dhoni-faces-tricky-Kiwis-test-in-series-decider/articleshow/55110229.cms','India v New Zealand, 5th ODI, Vizag: Under-fire Dhoni faces tricky Kiwis test in series-decider','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-55110376,width-400,resizemode-4/55110376.jpg]','VISAKHAPATNAM: Mahendra Singh Dhonis leadership as well as finishing skills will be put through a stern test when an inconsistent India take on a rejuvenated New Zealand in the series-deciding fifth and final cricket ODI, here on Saturday. ALSO READ: Dhoni needs strong support cast to rediscover finishing touch With the series locked at 2-2, Dhoni and his men will be eager to clinch the issue while history beckons Kane Williamsons men as they have a glorious opportunity to taste their maiden success in a bilateral ODI rubber.

ALSO READ: We are geared up for the series decider, says Ross Taylor While Dhonis captaincy may not be under immediate threat but a series loss against New Zealand will certainly raise questions about Captain Cools ability to marshall his resources after his much publicised admission of being unable to rotate strike lower down the order. Under Dhoni, India lost three ODI series - 1-2 against Bangladesh in Bangladesh, 1-4 against Australia Down Under and 2-3 at home against South Africa. The only ODI series victory in the last 18 months has been against a lowly Zimbabwe. Away from home for four months spanning two continents, New Zealands only success was a 2-0 win against a lowly Zimbabwe, following which they drew South Africa 1-1 before being whitewashed 0-3 by India in the Tests. Their ODI campaign started off on a sour note in Dharamasala but some strong batting performances by skipper Kane Williamson and Martin Guptill in Delhi and Ranchi respectively have managed to catch India off guard and level the five-match series 2-2. That they have never won against India in four bilateral contests since 1988 will be a big motivation for the Black Caps to buck the trend and return home with an act of redemption. Weather permitting, a tantalising finish is on the cards as India would be equally hungry for success at the Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium, a venue where they boast of a 4-1 record. Their last win has been against Sri Lanka, a 5-0 whitewash way back in November-2014 and an under-fire Dhoni would not want another series loss at the fag end of his career. The world No.4 India have just three more ODIs, against England, ahead of the coveted Champions Trophy in June next year and it would be an opportunity for Dhoni to give them a boost against a team which is ranked a notch higher. The over-reliance on Virat Kohli has also been evident during the series as Indian Test captain was the prime performer in both victories during the first four matches so far. With their opening pair of Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane yet to provide a much-needed solid start, Indias batting is centred around their no 1 batsman Kohli. Consider this, Indias both the wins of the series had Kohli anchor the chase be it the 85 not out in a low-scoring chase in Dharamsala, or his majestic unbeaten 154 that hunted down New Zealands challenging 285 in Mohali. Chasing a modest 261 in the fourth ODI in Ranchi, Rahane returned to form with a half-century while Kohli looked in full flow on a slow wicket but both failed to convert their starts, and it was a familiar story for the inexperienced middle-order. Failure or not, Indian fabled opener Sharma has been a permanent member of the line-up with Dhoni seeming to be in no mood to give youngsters the chance and Mandeep Singh is seen warming the bench. Sharmas last big knock came in Australia, and its been more than nine months hes yet to score a century in either longer or shorter format. His scores in the ongoing series read 14, 15, 13 and 11, something that is hurting Indias cause more than anything else. Its high time that the world record holder for ODI individual score of 264 return to form in the most-important match of the series, and at his mothers home town he would hope to make it special. Its the same venue where Dhoni had got instant stardom with his fiery 123-ball 148 to take India to a huge 356/9 in their 58-run win over Pakistan in the first match of the venue. The Dhoni special had come batting at no 3. The Indian skipper may not be like the old Dhoni but having promoted to no 4 in Mohali where he scored a 91-ball 80 his intentions are right, if not his reflexes. Following up with his brilliant half-century, Dhoni disappointed his home crowd with a 31-ball 11 before being cleaned up by James Neesham, and missing the line completely. In his heyday, he would have dispatched it for six but Dhoni is struggling to get back to his old rhythm. He has also made a stunning revelation of losing ability to freely rotate in the middle as to expect a Dhoni special would be like expecting a youngster to finish a chase. As for bowling, India have done reasonably well, especially the spin trio of Amit Mishra, Axar Patel and part-timer Kedar Jadhav who have ensured that they have not missed the regulars, R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. On pace front, India would hope that Jasprit Bumrah who was indisposed and was replaced by a lacklustre Dhawal Kulkarni returns to full fitness. Opener Martin Guptills return to form in Ranchi to go with the consistency of Tom Latham who has five half-centuries from seven matches, combined Tests and ODIs, on the tour will give New Zealand a massive advantage up front. Skipper Williamson at number 3 too has been consistent but its their middle order who has often frittered away good starts, be it in Ranchi where they were on course for 300 or in the previous ODIs. Left-arm spinner Anton Devcich who was included as a third spinner in Ranchi looked ordinary as Williamson may not mind bringing back either Corey Anderson or Matt Henry. With conditions overcast, the last thing India would want is a wash-out. Despite weakening, cyclone Kyant and has gone further down south, theres forecast of localised downpours as both the teams will keep their fingers crossed. The venue is slated to host its maiden Test in less than a months time, when India take on England from November 17. As a matter of fact, around the same time Visakhapatnam was ravaged by cyclone Hudhud and the scheduled last ODI here between India and West Indies was cancelled without a ball bowled on October 14, 2014. It remains to be seen whether India give themselves a Diwali gift or New Zealand return home with their heads held high.

It rained the previous night and though there was no rain during the day time, the possibility of it coming down on match day is not ruled out. However, weather forecast says that cyclone Kyant has weakened and chances of it washing out the game is less but a few spells of rain are still on the card.

ALSO READ: MS Dhoni slogs it out ahead of series decider Coming back to the series, the New Zealanders, after being thrashed in the three-match Test series, were expected to put up a much improved show in the One-dayers - a format which they have done well in over the years. Even though they managed to level the series, the Kiwis havent put in a dominant performance. Both matches which they won were close affairs as the Indians failed to hold their nerve. To the credit of the Kiwis+ , they hung in when the going got tough and managed to keep the hosts from running away with the series and thereby making the final game a competitive one. ALSO READ: We would like to do what no other NZ side has done, says Southee The problem for them has been the inability of the batsmen to dominate the Indian bowling especially the spinners. In the Ranchi game, the Kiwis ploy to go after the pacers paid rich dividends as they garnered 80 runs in the first 10 overs. But once the spinners came on, they struggled and the final 10 overs yielded a normal 61 runs. ALSO READ: Under-fire Dhoni faces tricky Kiwis test in series-decider Opener Tom Latham has been the most consistent batsman for the Kiwis in this series and skipper Kane Williamson has struck a century in the Delhi game, but the rest havent been consistent. The return to form of Martin Guptill augurs well for the visitors but the middle-order batsmen will have to give one final push if they fancy their chances against a determined India, who are keen on not losing the series. Indias problem has been finding a suitable replacement for skipper MS Dhoni+ in the No.6 & 7 spot. The ageing warrior has slowed down and his inability to pull off his trademark strokes at the death has hurt the side much. He, has, however showed that he can still contribute to the side as he did with an 80 in the third game in Mohali. The trouble is that his move up the order makes life easy from him but it doesnt solve the teams concerns. A finisher at the end of the innings - a role which Captain Cool essayed with consummate ease for many years - is the call of the hour. The hosts have placed their trust in the likes of Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav+ and Hardik Pandya but the youngsters have not been able to deliver yet. However, Dhoni+ has called for patience with the inexperienced batting. While there is no doubt that India need to plan ahead especially keeping in mind the Champions Trophy, its the immediate future that counts and Dhoni & co will have to step up their game if they dont want to dampen the festive mood.','SPORTS-NEW-ZEALAND-IN-INDIA-2016','Solomon S Kumar','2016-10-29 08:35:00','| TNN | Oct 29, 2016, 08:35 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:25'),(402,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/man-kills-wife-after-tiff-over-gutkha/articleshow/62050581.cms','Man kills wife after tiff over gutkha','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62050600,width-400,resizemode-4/62050600.jpg]','KANPUR: An argument over excess consumption of gutkha led a man to kill his wife in a fit of rage in Kanpur on Monday.

Tax consultants stated that the GST portal was under maintenance since last two days and not a single return was uploaded. The 3B format of the GST, too, was changed without any prior notice to the assessees. Now, the tax consultants will have to change their software to match the changed 3B format. Talking to TOI, president of South Gujarat Commercial Tax Bar Association (SGCTBA) Prashant Shah said, \"The government had issued notification on November 15, allowing quarterly filing of GSTR-1 return for traders having turnover below Rs 1.5 crore. It has been almost one month since the notification was issued, the portal is not accepting the quarterly return and the penalty amount is getting accumulated in the traders account.\" During his visit to Surat, Union finance minister Arun Jaitely had promised the representatives from the trade and industry that GST portal issues will be resolved at the earliest.

The plan with a 30-year horizon will be conceived keeping in mind the traffic, rising number of vehicles and availability of public transport. This plan was conceptualized in 2008. However, as work on public transport systems remained at a slow pace, the mobility plan was put back in the shelves. But with BRTS and other means of public transport gaining popularity in city, the civic body has decided to revive the mobility plan and suggest an action plan for each road and mode of transport. The plan for next three decades will concentrate on alternate strategies of mobility including creating of more pedestrian-friendly streets and exploring waterway transport. \"This plan will focus on people and goods movement and not vehicles,\" said Shivanand Swamy of CEPT University, Ahmedabad, which is preparing the plan. Surats mobility plan will essentially focus on three modes of transport — BRTS, city bus system and the proposed metro rail network. \"We are also reviewing possibility of water transport on both shores of Tapi river,\" said Swamy and added that the SMC will also be creating a number of pedestrian-friendly streets in the city and bicycle tracks for which the work has already begun. Planners will also take into consideration repeated movements of goods in the city, especially in the walled city area, causing havoc in congested areas. \"We will also look into the possibility of reducing repeated movements of goods,\" said SMC town planner Debasis Basak. CEPT University is likely to submit the new draft plan to SMC by the end of December. It will also add suggestions for integrating road network with upcoming dedicated freight corridor which could be alleviated. Currently, Surat city has nearly 2,200km road network and nearly 275 city buses and 100 BRTS buses carrying a daily passenger load of about 2 lakh passengers on daily basis.','CITY-SURAT','','2017-12-15 04:00:00','TNN | Dec 15, 2017, 04:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:36'),(412,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/resident-doc-thrashed-at-new-civil-hospital/articleshow/62076149.cms','Resident doc thrashed at New Civil Hospital','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62076147,width-400,resizemode-4/62076147.jpg]','SURAT: A resident doctor was thrashed by at least 10 men at New Civil Hospital (NCH) after a 40-year-old woman patient died of illness here on Wednesday night.

The \"One Belt One Road\" is a maze of projects meant to connect China with Asia, Europe and Africa. \"It is not our intent to contain Chinas economic growth. They must grow. They still have hundreds of millions of people that need to move out of poverty. But we do pay close attention to their OBOR policy,\" Tillerson told the State Department employees in a town hall. The OBOR strategy articulates the Chinese view of their future of how theyre going to grow their economy, and how theyre going to protect that economic growth, and perhaps extend some of their own spheres of influence around the world, he noted. The Secretary of State borrowed a quote from Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, \"China has One Belt, One Road; the United States and the global economy has many belts and many roads, and no one country gets to choose the belt or the road.\" \"Its part of the global order, the international system of rules and norms. China can choose to carry out its OBOR within that system, or it can try to redefine that. And thats what a lot of the discussion between us is about: How are we going to live together? How are both of us going to be prosperous together?\" the top US diplomat sought to know. China, he said, has been cooperating on North Korea, but it needs to do more. \"In some respects, it was a good way to start this new administrations relationship with China because it gave us something of a shared objective from the very beginning to pursue. And they were very open to hearing our approach and have been supportive in that regard,\" he said. Trump administrations engagement with China kicked off with the visit of President Xi Jinping to the US Presidents Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. Now there are four dialogues with China: diplomatic and security dialogue, economic and trade dialogue, law enforcement and cyber security dialogue, and people-to-people dialogue. \"All four of these high-level dialogues met throughout the year and reported out the status of those discussions and President Trumps recent state visit to Beijing. Our message to the Chinese in these dialogues was these need to be results-based dialogues, not just meet and talk. We have to produce something that moves this relationship forward,\" Tillerson said. These dialogues, he said, are serving very important purposes because behind all of these discussions is trying to understand what is going to define the US-China relationship for the next half century. \"How are we going to live together, two great powers with great peoples that need to be - have needs that need to be served? So thats framing much of the China policy in our engagement, and obviously, there are significant national security issues,\" he said. The Secretary of State said relationship with China has been pretty well defined since the opening of China with Nixons historic visit over the past many years with the \"One China\" policy, the commitment to the three communiques, and it did - it has led to a period of calm, prosperity as Chinas economy has grown. \"All of us have benefited globally with Chinas economic growth. But now, a lot of things have kind of gotten out of balance, as you well know,\" he said. \"The dialogue were having with the Chinese today is okay, that worked for the last 40 to 50 years, but China is in a different place now. You are in many respects still a developing nation because you have millions of people that are yet to move out of poverty and to middle class status, but youre not the developing China of the Nixon era. Youre in a different place today and were in a different place,\" he said. On the South China Sea, Tillerson said it is one area where the two countries hold significant differences and that they have to deal with it. \"Chinas continued building of these structures in the South China Sea in territories that are disputed - others lay claim to - and then further militarising those structures is a very serious issue that we talk about routinely,\" he said. Tillerson noted that the contentious South China Sea issue is \"a concern to many of our allies and trading partners in the Southeast Asia region.\" China claims almost all of the South China Sea but Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over the waterway.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-13 17:04:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 13, 2017, 17:04 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:39'),(416,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-house-senate-leaders-reach-deal-on-taxes/articleshow/62063843.cms','US House, Senate leaders reach deal on taxes','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62063844,width-400,resizemode-4/62063844.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Confident congressional Republicans forged an agreement Wednesday on a major overhaul of the nations tax laws that would provide generous tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans — Donald Trump among them — and deliver the first major legislative accomplishment to the GOP president. Middle- and low-income families would get smaller tax cuts, though Trump and GOP leaders have billed the package as a huge benefit for the middle class. The measure would scrap a major tax requirement of Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act, a step toward the ultimate GOP goal of unraveling the law. \"The cynical voices that opposed tax cuts grow smaller and weaker, and the American people grow stronger,\" Trump said at the White House. \"This is for people of middle income, this is for companies that are going to create jobs. This is for very, very special people, the great people of America.\" The business tax cuts would be permanent, but reductions for individuals would expire after a decade — saving money to comply with Senate budget rules. In all, the bill would cut taxes by about $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, adding billions to the nations mounting debt. The legislation, which is still being finalized, would cut the top tax rate for the wealthy from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, slash the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and allow homeowners to deduct interest only on the first $750,000 of a new mortgage. The top tax rate currently applies to income above $470,000 for married couples, though lawmakers are reworking the tax brackets. The standard deduction would be nearly doubled, to $24,000 for married couples. Details of the agreement were described by Republican senators and congressional aides. \"Its not my vision of the perfect, but again, this is definitely going to be a strong pro-growth tax package,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. Republicans see passage of the legislation as a political imperative, proving to voters they can govern as the GOP fights to hold onto its majorities in the House and Senate. Republicans said they expect the package to increase economic growth, generating additional tax revenue and lessening the hit to the budget deficit. Independent economists arent as optimistic. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she and her colleagues expect a \"modest lift\" to economic growth from the tax package. Yellen said at a news conference the likelihood of lower taxes is why Fed officials expect the economy to grow at 2.5 percent in 2018. But growth would then slip back closer to its recent 2 percent average. She said that any wage growth would likely stem from the low unemployment rate rather than the tax cuts. Negotiators have removed several controversial provisions from the tax bill, including one that would have eliminated the deduction for interest on student loans and another deduction for medical expenses, said two congressional aides. Also, the bill would no longer start taxing graduate-school tuition waivers, said the aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss private negotiations. The tax bill would scale back the deduction for state and local taxes, allowing families to deduct only up to a total of $10,000 in property and income taxes. The deduction is especially important to residents of high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California. Business owners who report business income on their personal tax returns would be able to deduct 20 percent of that income. The bill would repeal the mandate that most Americans get health insurance, a provision of the 2010 health care law. Republicans suffered a humiliating defeat this past summer when they were unable to dismantle the health care law after seven years of promises. Scrapping the individual mandate would provide them with more than $300 billion for deeper tax cuts while undermining the law. Senate leaders plan to vote on the package Tuesday. If it passes, the House would vote next. GOP leaders hope to send the bill to Trump before Christmas. \"Lets not waver now — lets not give in to the Washington status quo — not when tax reform is so close,\" said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. The measure has come under assault by Democrats who say it is unfairly tilted in favor of business and the wealthy. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said the public doesnt know all the details of the bill, \"but they smell whats going on and that is tax cuts for the wealthiest and no help for so many in the middle class.\" Schumer predicted that the politically unpopular bill would drag down Republicans in next years congressional elections. \"I believe theyll pay a very steep price for this bill in 2018,\" he said. The agreement was reached hours before a joint House-Senate conference committee met in public for the first time. The committee is charged with blending the tax bills passed by the House and Senate, though Republicans have done all of their negotiations behind closed doors. Democrats have not been included in any substantive talks on the bill. The full details will be unveiled by the end of the week, Brady said. Once the plan is signed into law, workers could start seeing changes in the amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks early next year, lawmakers said — though taxpayers wont file their 2018 returns until the following year. The IRS said in a statement Wednesday that taxpayers could begin seeing less money withheld from their paychecks \"as early as February.\" The agency said it was taking initial steps to prepare withholding guidance for employers, which it expects to issue in January. Corporate tax cuts would take effect in January, allowing businesses to immediately write off the full cost of capital investments.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-14 10:26:00','AP | Dec 14, 2017, 10:26 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:39'),(417,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-regulator-orders-rollback-of-net-neutrality-rules/articleshow/62075678.cms','US regulators rollback net neutrality rules','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62075705,width-400,resizemode-4/62075705.jpg?imglength=95142]','WASHINGTON: US regulators today voted to rollback \"net neutrality\" rules that require internet providers to treat all traffic equally. The Federal Communications Commission, in a 3-2 vote, adopted a proposal by Republican appointed chairman Indian- American Ajit Pai. The critics say the move is against the interest of the consumers and favours big corporate companies. By doing so, the Republican-majority commission has reversed the 2015 \"net-neutrality\" ruled of the previous Obama Administration, which mandated upon all internet service providers to treat all traffic equally, without blocking or showing content. The decision restores the longstanding, bipartisan light-touch regulatory framework that has fostered rapid Internet growth, openness, and freedom for nearly 20 years, the FCC said in a statement after the voting. Following detailed legal and economic analysis, as well as extensive examination of comments from consumers and stakeholders, the Commission reversed the FCCs 2015 heavy- handed utility-style regulation of broadband Internet access service, which imposed substantial costs on the entire Internet ecosystem, it said. In place of that heavy-handed framework, the FCC is returning to the traditional light-touch framework that was in place until 2015, it asserted. Moreover, the FCC also adopted robust transparency requirements that will empower consumers as well as facilitate effective government oversight of broadband providers conduct, it said. \"In particular, the FCCs action has restored the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission to act when broadband providers engage in anticompetitive, unfair, or deceptive acts or practices,\" the federal commission said. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi described Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said FCCs radical, partisan decision to dismantle net neutrality \"strikes a stunning blow\" to the promise of a free and open Internet. \"With this unjustified and blatant giveaway to big providers, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is proving himself an eager executor of the Trump Administrations anti-consumer, anti- competition agenda,\" she said. Pelosi alleged that FCCs rule change process was marked by haste, secrecy and technical flaws from the start. \"This arbitrary decision was made without a single public hearing and over the firm opposition of Internet experts and technologists,\" she said. \"It is deeply disturbing that Pais FCC has refused to take action to combat the threat of identity theft and fake comments in the agency record, and has refused to comply with FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests or requests for information from the New York Attorney Generals Investigation,\" Pelosi said. House Speaker Paul Ryan welcomed the decision. \"Despite its unassuming name, the Obama administrations net neutrality regulation threatens the free and open internet that has done so much to advance modern society,\" he said. The Trump administrations action to roll back this egregious government overreach into the most innovative space will benefit all users of the internet, he said. As Chairman Pai outlined today, the way to protect consumers is to put the Federal Trade Commission back on the beat to crack down on those who would abuse open access. This new plan of action will open new avenues for telemedicine, distance learning, and future innovations, Ryan said. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the Trump Administration backs the FCCs move but also supports a free and fair internet.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-15 01:07:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 15, 2017, 01:07 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:40'),(418,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deadly-california-wildfire-continues-to-grow/articleshow/62094243.cms','Deadly California wildfire continues to grow','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62094244,width-400,resizemode-4/62094244.jpg]','SANTA BARBARA: Calming winds Friday gave firefighters a chance to gain ground against a huge wildfire in coastal mountains northwest of Los Angeles but the blaze continued to surge west, endangering thousands of homes, as forecasts called for a renewal of gusty winds. The so-called Thomas Fire, the fourth-largest in California history, was 35 percent contained Friday night after sweeping across 400 square miles (about 1,036 sq. kilometers) of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties since it erupted on December 4. Between Thursday night and Friday morning, the blaze claimed another 3,000 acres as it fed on brush and timber killed by Californias long drought or a week of hot, dry weather. Santa Barbara has had only a tiny amount of rain since Oct. 1, the start of the new water year, and is more than 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) below normal to date. Firefighters continued to carve firebreaks above the communities of Santa Barbara, Carpinteria, Summerland and Montecito and state fire officials said evacuations would be called as needed as flames advanced. The fire already has destroyed more than 1,000 buildings, including well over 700 homes, and threatens 18,000 more structures. Another focus of firefighting was on the eastern flank in canyons where a state firefighter was killed Thursday near the agricultural town of Fillmore. The death of Cory Iverson, 32, was announced by Chief Ken Pimlott of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection but he released no information about the circumstances, citing an ongoing investigation by an accident review team. Iverson was an engineer with a strike team from the San Diego area and had been with Cal Fire since 2009. He is survived by his wife, who is pregnant, and a 2-year-old daughter, as well as his parents and other family. The National Weather Service forecast extreme fire danger or \"red flag\" conditions through at least Saturday evening, with winds gusting to 40 mph in the Santa Barbara County mountains where the fire is burning. Firefighters were facing first northerly \"sundowner\" winds through the night that could turn into northeasterly Santa Ana winds, driving the flames in another direction. Everything about the fire was massive, from a footprint larger than that of many cities to the sheer scale of destruction that cremated entire neighborhoods or the legions attacking it: more than 8,000 firefighters from nearly a dozen states, aided by 32 helicopters and 78 bulldozers. Firefighting costs were approaching $89 million. Meanwhile, firefighters continued to deal with the loss of their own. All 17 of the firefighters on Cory Iversons five-engine strike team were pulled off the fire lines after his death. On Thursday night, Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean called for a moment of silence during a meeting for Fillmore residents. \"As I was up in the canyon and I watched his fire brethren remove his flag-draped body from the canyon in the hills above where we sit right here, I couldnt help but think about his pregnant wife and his young daughter who will never see their husband and father again,\" Dean said. It was the second death linked to the fire. The body of a 70-year-old woman was found in a crashed car on an evacuation route last week.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-16 13:59:00','AP | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 13:59 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:40'),(419,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-signs-692-billion-defence-budget/articleshow/62051593.cms','Trump signs $692 billion defence budget','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62052213,width-400,resizemode-4/62052213.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Terming it a \"momentous step\", President Donald Trump signed a $692 billion defence budget which will give legislative authority to implement his South Asia strategy and authorise critical missile capabilities to confront North Koreas threats. Trump signed the budget at the White House on Tuesday while noting that the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) could not have come at a more opportune or important time. The NDAA authorises $626 billion of the base budget resources for the Department of Defence and the national security programmes of the Department of Energy, providing an additional $66 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. It approves $26.2 billion for shipbuilding, including multi-year procurement of Virginia class submarines, $10.1 billion to procure 90 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft and $2.2 billion for Army ground combat vehicles. The budget would give legislative authority to implement his South Asia strategy and authorises critical missile capabilities to confront threats posed by North Korea. Trump had sought a major role for India in bringing peace in Afghanistan and ruled out a hasty withdrawal of troops from the war-torn nation while announcing his new Afghanistan and South Asia policy in August. \"This legislation represents a momentous step toward rebuilding our military and securing the future for our children,\" he said. He rued that the military had undergone a series of deep budget cuts in recent years that have severely impacted its readiness, shrunk capabilities, and placed substantial burdens on warfighters. \"Today, with the signing of this defence bill, we accelerate the process of fully restoring Americas military might,\" he said, adding that this legislation will enhance readiness, expand and modernise forces and help provide service members with the tools that they need to fight and to win. \"We will fight and win. But hopefully, with this, we wont have to fight because people will not be wanting to fight with us. It authorises funding for our continued campaign to obliterate the Islamic State. As you know, weve won in Syria, weve won in Iraq. But they spread to other areas and were getting them as fast as they spread,\" Trump said. \"Weve had more success with the ISIS in the last eight months than the entire previous administration has had during its entire term,\" Trump said. NDAA-2018 approves missile defence capabilities to create maximum pressure on the vile dictatorship in North Korea, he said. \"It upgrades our Ground Combat Vehicles, allows for the purchase of new Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, and paves the way for beautiful new Virginia-class submarines - the finest in the world,\" Trump said.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-13 15:12:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 13, 2017, 15:12 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:41'),(420,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/things-to-know-about-alabamas-new-us-senator-doug-jones/articleshow/62047538.cms','Things to know about Alabamas new US senator, Doug Jones','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62047539,width-400,resizemode-4/62047539.jpg]','BIRMINGHAM: Doug Jones, a Democrat who once prosecuted two Ku Klux Klansmen in a deadly church bombing and has now broken the Republican lock grip on Alabama, is the states new US senator. Here are some facts about Jones: CLOSE TO HOME Jones, 63, grew up in the working-class city of Fairfield, just west of Birmingham, an area where steel mills once belched smoke that left a rust-colored haze hanging over the metro area. His father was a steelworker and so was one of his grandfathers; the other worked in a coal mine. Jones spent time working in a mill when not in school. Now an attorney in private practice, Jones lives just a few miles from his hometown in the hilly suburb of Mountain Brook, Alabamas richest locale with an average family income estimated by the US Census Bureau at $225,000 annually. DEMOCRATIC ROOTS Jones got his start in government as an aide to the last Democrat elected to the US Senate from Alabama, the late Howell Heflin. After graduating from Samford Universitys law school in 1979, Jones worked as staff counsel to the Judiciary Committee for Heflin, and Jones still considers Heflin a role model. Heflin cited his health in retiring from the Senate, and Republican Jeff Sessions was elected to replace him in 1996. Jones will now assume the seat vacated by Sessions when he was nominated as US attorney general by President Donald Trump. Republican appointee Luther Strange has held the seat in the interim. CHURCH BOMBING Years before running for Senate, Jones made a name for himself prosecuting two KKK members for the bombing of Birminghams 16th Street Baptist Church, a brutal crime that killed four black girls in 1963. One Klansman was convicted in the blast in 1977, and a renewed investigation was underway by the time President Bill Clinton appointed Jones as US attorney in Birmingham in 1997. Jones led a team of federal and state attorneys during trials that resulted in the convictions of Thomas Blanton Jr. in 2001 and Bobby Frank Cherry in 2002. Last year, Jones was among the speakers who urged Alabamas parole board to refuse an early release for Blanton. The board agreed, and Blanton remains in prison serving life for murder. PARTY GUY Alabamas Democratic Party has been on life support since Republicans gained ascendency years ago, holding no statewide offices and a minority in each legislative chamber, but Jones supported an effort to revive the organization in 2013. A former party chairman formed the Alabama Democratic Majority to raise money and recruit candidates, and Jones was among those publicly supportive of the effort. The foundation was dormant by 2014, but Trumps victory has helped breathe new life into local organizations, including the Democratic Party in Republican-heavy Shelby County, where officials say membership has jumped from around a dozen to more than 200 people since the 2016 election. Jones victory can only help re-energize the party even more.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-13 09:30:00','AP | Dec 13, 2017, 09:30 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:42'),(421,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-paris-climate-accord-no-problem-says-bloc-of-states/articleshow/62073938.cms','No Paris climate accord? No problem, says bloc of states','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62073904,width-400,resizemode-4/62073904.jpg]','HAMPTON: Since President Donald Trump vowed this summer to pull the United States out of an international climate accord, states looking to tackle carbon pollution have been forced to go it alone. More than a dozen formed an alliance committed to reducing emissions in line with the Paris accord, an international agreement that aims to halt the rise in global temperatures. Several state leaders, including California Gov. Jerry Brown, were in Paris this week for a climate summit two years after the historic accord was signed. The summit offered updates on promised funding for poor countries to address climate change, the latest research on ways to cut emissions as well as the corporate worlds response to the problem. Others, wanting to be more ambitious, are taking a look at the countrys only regional program that mandates emission reductions in the power sector. Known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, it covers nine states in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic and is poised to expand. \"The clear signal from the Trump administration that they were going to pull back on environmental policy throws it back at the states and says, `OK, its your game, said William Shobe, a professor of public policy at the University of Virginia. \"A number of states are responding, saying, `OK, were up to that and were going to go ahead and implement policy. The program sets limits on power plant emissions and requires them to purchase allowances equal to the amount of those emissions. Money raised through those allowances at quarterly auctions goes back to the states. The only other program of its kind is in California, which covers the states entire economy. It linked up with Quebecs cap-and-trade program in 2014 and will expand to include Ontarios next year. Since it began in 2008, RGGI has led to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent in the states stretching from Maine to Maryland, 16 percent more than other states without emissions programs. The program has also sent $2.8 billion back to the states, money that has funded a range of environmental programs, including energy efficiency upgrades at a middle school and library in Massachusetts, expansion of solar power in New York, and green measures at a brewery in New Hampshire. \"Young consumers dont have any patience for companies that are not consciously involved in reducing their footprint and their impact on the planet. I think that runs pretty deep, said Peter Egelston, as he led a tour of his Smuttynose Brewing Co. in Hampton, whose facility includes solar tubes that allow more natural light into the brewery and a high-tech milling system that gets more yield out of the malted barley. Since the November elections, Virginia announced it is taking steps to become the first Southern state to join the regional cap-and-trade program, while New Jersey has promised to rejoin the pact. If they get on board, member states would represent a combined gross domestic product of $3.9 trillion, which if they were a country would displace Germany as the fourth-largest economy, according to the Acadia Center, a nonprofit that promotes clean energy. Virginias climate strategy, approved last month, would limit emissions from most power plants starting in 2020, followed by a 30 percent reduction over a decade. Eligible carbon emitters would have to participate in the regional greenhouse gas program. \"We do not have the luxury of waiting for Washington to wake up to this threat we must act now, Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe said in a statement. New Jersey is set to rejoin the regional program when Democratic Governor elect Phil Murphy takes office Jan. 16, succeeding GOP Gov. Chris Christie, who pulled the state out of the regional agreement, arguing it drove up electricity costs. Still, RGGI has its doubters, many who contend its success has more to do with the changing energy landscape than government regulations. They argue the nine states were already switching from coal-fired to natural gas power plants when they joined the program which, according to a Duke University study , was responsible for a third of the reductions. Several states also instituted renewable energy goals that led to a shift toward wind, solar and hydro power that reduce emissions. Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group founded by billionaire Koch brothers, said the program has offered very few benefits and that such models cant solve the climate problem. It has called for New Hampshire to pull out and opposes New Jersey rejoining. \"Our view is that RGGI and other ideologically driven energy policies cause energy prices to go up, which disproportionally impacts the poor, said Levi Russell, an Americans For Prosperity spokesman. Still, supporters say the program has been a force for good reducing emissions and improving air quality without hurting economic growth. And with its emission cap set to become more stringent in 2020, said Dallas Burtraw, a senior fellow at the research institution Resources For The Future, RGGI could be even more ambitious than Obamas signature climate plan if ever went national. Obamas Clean Power Plan called for cutting emission in the power sector by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. It was put on hold by the Supreme Court and is being scrapped by Trump. \"We have a great success story to tell, said Katie Scharf Dykes, who chairs the RGGI board and the Connecticut public utilities agency. \"At this moment, this story is more relevant than ever before.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-14 22:30:00','AP | Dec 14, 2017, 22:30 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:42'),(422,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-open-to-possible-talks-with-north-korea-says-tillerson/articleshow/62053008.cms','US open to possible talks with North Korea, says Tillerson','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62053063,width-400,resizemode-4/62053063.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says the US is open to possible talks with North Korea.

Akayed Ullah, 27, suspected bomber, had a crude pipe bomb strapped to his body. The device exploded prematurely on Monday between two subway platforms near Port Authority, injuring him and three others. Bangladesh security officials said that they have found no evidence of a local militant link of Ullah despite his fascination to Islamist literatures. \"We have not found any link between Akayed Ullah and local militant groups or any political party. We have not found any clue of his affiliation with any militant outfit in Bangladesh,\" police counter-terrorism unit chief Monirul Islam told reporters. His wife told investigators that Ullah used to \"encourage\" her to read books by a convicted Islamist outfit chief Jashim Uddin Rahmani as he appeared to have been radicalised over the internet after moving to the United States, he said. \"She said he used to tell her to read the books of Jashim Uddin Rahmani to learn about religion or Islam. We are reviewing the information provided by his wife and other relatives,\" Islam said. Rahmani, the leader of the outlawed Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), was jailed by a Bangladesh court in 2015 for five years for inciting the murder of atheist blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider in Dhaka. His books were easily accessible on the internet until some years ago. The ABT is a homegrown extremist group which is behind the killings of several bloggers, writers and gay rights activists in Bangladesh. Reports suggest that US officials have found evidence that Ullah had watched Islamic State propaganda on the internet. Islam said that though no official request has been made, Bangladesh passed on the information on Ullah to US security agencies on its own as \"we have given highest priority on this issue because of our zero-tolerance policy against terrorism\". An official familiar with the investigation said Ulllahs wife was \"surprised to find out what her husband did\" after he exploded a pipe bomb strapped to his body which he did some 30 minutes after his routine telephonic talks with her. Bangladesh polices counter-terrorism unit questioned her and other relatives for several hours. Police said that Ullah, who became a US resident in 2011, visited Bangladesh three months ago and spent most of the time at home with their six-month-old son. Ullah is suspected of trying to blow himself up at New Yorks main bus terminal presumably inspired by Islamic State ideals while investigators are trying to unearth what led to the bombing, and who - if anyone - might have assisted him. His improvised explosive device, however, did not work as intended, causing minor injuries to bystanders. Authorities took the suspect into custody alive and later brought federal charges against Ullah, who has so far appeared to be the lone wolf in plotting and staging the attack.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-13 19:24:00','PTI | Dec 13, 2017, 19:24 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:44'),(424,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-take-unilateral-steps-in-areas-of-divergence-with-pakistan-us/articleshow/62096381.cms','Will take unilateral steps in areas of divergence with Pakistan: US','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62096524,width-400,resizemode-4/62096524.jpg]','WASHINGTON: The US will take \"unilateral steps in areas of divergence\" with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism, the Pentagon on Saturday told Congress and insisted that there must be \"fundamental change\" in the way Islamabad deals with terrorist safe havens on its territory.

Although Pakistani military operations have disrupted some militant sanctuaries, certain extremist groups - such as the Taliban and the Haqqani Network - retain freedom of movement in Pakistan, it said. \"The United States continues to convey to all levels of Pakistani leadership the importance of taking action against all terrorist and extremist groups,\" the Pentagon said. Increased collaboration between Afghanistan and Pakistan is critical to maintaining pressure on militant and terrorist groups and for meeting the enduring security requirements on both sides of the shared border, it said. \"The trust deficit resulting from Pakistans support of and inaction against Afghan-oriented extremists, and Pakistans concerns about terrorist attacks launched from Afghanistan, hampers the bilateral military collaboration required to achieve enduring security,\" the Pentagon said. According to the report, the hard-won gains in Afghanistan remain fragile, but are worth defending. Under the new strategy, US diplomatic, military, and economic resources are aligned in support of a negotiated settlement to this long-running war. \"We have recommitted to helping the Afghan government and people navigate through these challenges with a new approach that leverages additional support from allies, partners, and regional actors,\" it said. \"Our commitment is enduring but not unlimited, our support is not a blank check. As long as the Afghan government continues to show real progress and make real reforms, we will continue to support them as our strategic partners in the fight against international terrorism,\" the report said. \"The Taliban cannot win on the battlefield.

Holly Baird, a spokeswoman for Weinstein, issued a statement on his behalf on Wednesday night disputing Hayeks account and calling her allegations of sexual misconduct inaccurate. More than 50 women have claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them over the past three decades. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the accusations against Weinstein. Hayeks spokeswoman had no immediate comment on Wednesday. Police in New York, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and London have said they are investigating allegations of sexual assault or rape by Weinstein. Hayek wrote in the article that she was inspired to share her experiences after other women came forward. Her account largely centered around the time she was involved with making the 2002 film, \"Frida,\" in which she portrayed Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. Hayek wrote that she was pleased to have the opportunity to work with Weinstein and Miramax, which he then owned, because it was \"synonymous with quality, sophistication and risk taking in films.\" But, she wrote, she found herself rebuffing sexual advances and requests from Weinstein. \"No to letting him give me oral sex,\" Hayek wrote as one of several examples. \"And with every refusal came Harveys Machiavellian rage.\" Nervous breakdown Hayek wrote that Weinstein was threatening to shut down the production of \"Frida\" and that he pressured her into doing a sex scene with another woman in the film.

Baird issued a statement on behalf of Weinstein that disputed Hayeks version of events. \"Mr. Weinstein regards Salma Hayek as a first-class actress and cast her in several of his movies, among them Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Dogma, and Studio 54. He was very proud of her Best Actress Academy Award nomination for Frida and continues to support her work,\" the statement said. \"While Jennifer Lopez was interested in playing Frida and at the time was a bigger star, Mr. Weinstein overruled other investors to back Salma as the lead,\" it said. The statement also said Miramax put up half of the money in a film with a budget of more than $12 million, and also noted that there was \"creative friction\" on the film, which it said \"served to drive the project to perfection.\" \"Mr Weinstein does not recall pressuring Salma to do a gratuitous sex scene with a female costar and he was not there for the filming,\" the statement said. \"All of the sexual allegations as portrayed by Salma are not accurate and others who witnessed the events have a different account of what transpired.\"','WORLD-US','','2017-12-14 11:49:00','Reuters | Updated: Dec 14, 2017, 11:49 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:46'),(427,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-loses-alabama-senate-seat-to-democrats-in-shock-defeat/articleshow/62056280.cms','Trump loses Alabama Senate seat to Democrats in shock defeat','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62056363,width-400,resizemode-4/62056363.jpg]','President Trump on Tuesday managed to lose a US Senate seat in the conservative Deep South that Democrats had not won in decades.

Moore lost by less than one per cent (about 20000 statewide votes)to Democrat Doug Jones, with the result narrowing Republican majority in the chamber to 51-49. Democrats rejoiced and gloated over the result once their got over their disbelief at the stroke of good fortune.

But Trump decided to heed the advice of party hardliners, mainly Steve Bannon, is backing a loathsome candidate who believes America was better off when there was slavery and women couldnt vote. Consequently, Jones won an unexpected, shock victory in a state where Democrats have never won more than 40 per cent of the vote and are usually also-rans. Expectedly, neither Moore not Trump would come to terms with the shock result. Moore said the margin was narrow enough to merit a recount, although GOP bosses, never too enthusiastic about his candidature in the first place, rebuffed him. Trump as usual washed his hands of Moore and said he always knew he was going to lose in a grudging congratulatory message. But he was said to be seething at the result, which is certain to change equations within the party and dilute the hands of Steve Bannon, the former White House advisor who continues to have an inside line to Trump.

Among those who had implicitly warned against Moores character and candidature was Trumps own daughter Ivanka, who said there was a special place in hell for people who hard children, even as Moore sought to escape the stigma of assaulting underaged women and children. Moore was considered so loathsome that even the states senior senator Richard Shelby was said to have voted against him, while many other GOP lawmakers simply did not turn up to support him. With the Republican majority now down to 51, President Trump will have a tough time advancing his agenda in the Senate, including his ability to confirm judges and ward off inquiries into his conduct that a recharged Democrats will now pursue.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1513138121000 Jones takes over the seat previously held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The term expires in January of 2021. The victory by Jones, a former US attorney best known for prosecuting two Ku Klux Klansmen responsible for Birminghams infamous 1963 church bombing, narrows the GOP advantage in the US Senate to 51-49. That imperils already-uncertain Republican tax, budget and health proposals and injects tremendous energy into the Democratic Partys early push to reclaim House and Senate majorities in 2018. Still, many Washington Republicans viewed the defeat of Moore as perhaps the best outcome for the party nationally despite the short-term sting. The fiery Christian conservatives positions have alienated women, racial minorities, gays and Muslims — in addition to the multiple allegations that he was guilty of sexual misconduct with teens, one only 14, when he was in his 30s. \"Tonights results are clear — the people of Alabama deemed Roy Moore unfit to serve in the US Senate,\" said Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who leads the national GOPs Senate campaign arm and called on Moore to quit the race weeks ago. A number of Republicans declined to support him, including Alabamas long-serving Sen. Richard Shelby. But Trump lent his name and the national GOPs resources to Moores campaign in recent days. Had Moore won, the GOP would have been saddled with a colleague accused of sordid conduct as Republicans nationwide struggle with Trumps historically low popularity. Senate leaders had promised that Moore would have faced an immediate ethics investigation. Republicans on Capitol Hill have expressed hopes of scheduling a vote on their tax legislation before Jones is sworn in, but lawmakers are still struggling to devise a compromise bill to bridge the divide between the House and Senate legislation that can win majority support in both chambers. The Republican loss also gives Democrats a clearer path to a Senate majority in 2018 — albeit a narrow one — in an election cycle where Democrats are far more optimistic about seizing control of the House of Representatives. Ultimately, Tuesdays contest came down to which side better motivated its supporters to vote. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said turnout likely would not exceed 25 percent of registered voters. Jones successfully fought to cobble together an unlikely coalition of African-Americans, liberal whites and moderate Republicans. He had his strongest support across Alabamas \"black belt,\" named for the color of its soil, and in the larger urban areas, including Montgomery, Birmingham, Mobile, Tuscaloosa and Huntsville. Turnout in those areas, which features a large African-American population, also ran higher than in some of the more heavily Republican parts of the state. At his election night headquarters, stunned supporters erupted in celebration as news of his victory was announced. Many danced to the song \"Happy.\" Some cried. \"I honestly did not know that this was even an option. I didnt think that we could elect a Democrat,\" said 26-year-old campaign volunteer Jess Eddington, her eyes red from tears of joy. \"I am so proud we did.\" Moore, who largely avoided public events in the final weeks of the race and spent far less money on advertising than his opponent, bet big — and lost — on the states traditional Republican leanings and the strength of his passionate evangelical Christian supporters. He sidestepped questions about sexual misconduct as he arrived at his polling place on horseback earlier in the day. Alabama state law calls for a recount if the margin of victory is less than one-half of one percentage point. With all precincts reporting, Jones led by 1.5 points — three times that margin. If the secretary of state determines there were more write-in votes than the difference between Jones and Moore, the states counties would be required to tally those votes. Its not clear how that would help Moore, who ended the night trailing Jones by more than 20,000 votes. Democrats were not supposed to have a chance in Alabama, one of the most Republican-leaning states in the nation. Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton here by nearly 28 points just 13 months ago. Yet Moore had political baggage that repelled some moderate Republicans even before allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced. Virtually the entire Republican establishment, Trump included, supported Moores primary opponent, Sen. Luther Strange in September. Trumps former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, was one of the only early high-profile Moore backers. Moore was once removed from his position as state Supreme Court chief justice after he refused to remove a boulder-sized Ten Commandments monument at the state court building. A second time, he was permanently suspended for urging state probate judges to refuse marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Said Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez: \"The people of Alabama sent a loud and clear message to Donald Trump and the Republican Party: You cant call yourself the party of family values as long as youre willing to accept vile men like Roy Moore as members.\"','WORLD-US','','2017-12-13 11:24:00','AP | Updated: Dec 13, 2017, 11:24 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:47'),(429,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/firefighters-wrestle-to-control-massive-california-wildfire/articleshow/62046863.cms','Firefighters wrestle to control massive California wildfire','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62046871,width-400,resizemode-4/62046871.jpg]','CARPINTERIA: An out-of-control California wildfire that has already destroyed nearly 700 homes in its path of destruction crept closer to the upscale hillside community of Montecito on Tuesday despite calmer winds that slowed its progress. The Thomas Fire, which broke out on Dec. 4 near the community of Ojai, has since traveled 27 miles (43 km) to become the fifth-largest blaze in state history. It has blackened more than 368 square miles (953 square km) in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, an area larger than New York City. Officials said that while the conflagration charred another 2,500 acres overnight, a break in the hot, dry Santa Ana winds on Tuesday sapped its forward momentum and allowed crews to prevent further damage to homes. \"Its doing what we want it to do. The fire is staying away from the homes,\" said Captain Steve Concialdi of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The flames were 25 percent contained as of Tuesday evening. Concialdi said that some of the 7,000 firefighters deployed against the blaze had taken advantage of the better weather to set controlled burns in a canyon near the community of Carpinteria and near homes in an effort to further deprive the flames of fuel. The National Weather Service has warned that the Santa Ana winds could return as early as Wednesday, meaning that the fire remains dangerous and unpredictable. \"Severe fire weather will continue to promote significant fire growth further into Santa Barbara County, threatening the communities of Santa Barbara, Carpinteria, Montecito and Summerland,\" Cal Fire said in a statement. In Washington, members of the House of Representatives met with Vice President Mike Pence to discuss the crisis. Representative Julia Brownley, whose district includes Ventura, said all resources had arrived to fight the blaze, which could take another week to contain. In Carpinteria, Michelle Warner, who has lived in the seaside town her whole life, and her toddler daughter wore face masks to protect them from the thick smoke. Thanks to the firefighters efforts, Warner, a 45-year-old writer, said she had no plans to evacuate. \"We plan to stick it out for at least another day, hoping that conditions will get better,\" she said. The Thomas Fire has so far destroyed 904 structures, including 691 homes. Efforts to combat the flames, which have displaced more than 94,000 people, have cost more than $48 million. Many public schools in Santa Barbara and school districts nearby have canceled classes this week and will not reopen until the annual winter break is completed in January. Some of the other fires burning over the past week in San Diego and Los Angeles counties have been largely brought under control by the thousands of firefighters on the ground. The Los Angeles Fire Department said on Tuesday that investigators had determined that the Skirball Fire, which destroyed six homes in the posh Bel-Air community of the city, was started by a cooking fire at a homeless encampment underneath a freeway.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-13 08:32:00','Reuters | Dec 13, 2017, 08:32 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:49'),(430,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-agent-removed-from-russia-probe-called-trump-an-idiot/articleshow/62053454.cms','FBI agent removed from Russia probe called Trump an idiot','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62052953,width-400,resizemode-4/62052953.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Two FBI officials who would later be assigned to the special counsels investigation into Donald Trumps presidential campaign described him with insults like \"idiot and \"loathsome human in a series of text messages last year.

A bench of Justice Biswananth Rath said though the university authorities can continue with the selection process for the VCs post, they cannot publish the final results until the next hearing of the case. The court has granted a stay till December 19. \"Meanwhile, it has issued notices to the search committee, the chancellor of Ravenshaw and registrar of the university and University Grants Commission (UGC),\" said Debasish Mohakud, one of the counsels of the petitioner. The courts direction came in response to a petition filed by Nachiketa Das, who is an aspiring candidate for the vice-chancellor post. Das has alleged in his plea that Ravenshaw authorities are conducting the appointment of the VC by violating the norms of the UGC. Das has alleged that UGC norms clearly say the vice chancellor to be appointed should be an academician with a minimum of 10 years of experience as a professor in a university system or 10 years of experience in an equivalent position in a reputed research and/or academic administrative organisation. However, Ravenshaw authorities have made changes in the eligibility criteria for the VC post and are not taking into consideration the administrative experience. This is a gross violation of the UGC norms. Das has alleged that the changes in the eligibility criteria have been made this year only with ill-intentions. Notably, the current VC of Ravenshaw, P C Sarangis tenure ends on December 31 and the varsitys search committee has also started interviews for the selection of the next VC. In another related development, the Orissa high court has also stayed the recruitment of the contractual faculty members of Ravenshaw. The court has said the varsity can conduct interviews, but it cannot announce the results of the recruitment process. Two aspiring teachers had moved the high court alleging that throwing all norms to wind, the varsity authorities had advertised about the recruitment process on December 10 and will conduct an interview for faculty members on December 15. The hurried manner in which the recruitment process is being conducted has raised eyebrows. The petitioner further highlighted that neither the number of posts has been mentioned in the advertisement, nor has an adequate time limit been given for candidates to apply for the post.','CITY-BHUBANESWAR','Binita Jaiswal','2017-12-15 07:20:00','| TNN | Dec 15, 2017, 07:20 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:51'),(433,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/infant-sold-by-mother-rescued-from-salia-sahi/articleshow/62077208.cms','Infant sold by mother rescued from Salia Sahi','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62077207,width-400,resizemode-4/62077207.jpg]','BHUBANESWAR: The child welfare committee (CWC) here on Thursday rescued a three-month-old boy from a house in the Salia Sahi area following allegations that the childs mother had sold him to a couple nearly two months ago.

Jagannath Temple has access for only Hindus. \"We verified the travel documents of the foreigners—Maxim Verkhoturov from Divnogorsk, Yulia Shwlcova from Nizhny Novgorod, Dima Zeobin from Divnogorsk and Elena Solodehuk from Oktyabrsky—and would release them after routine questioning. Since their act is not a serious criminal offence, we would release them after issuing a warning. The foreigners insisted ignorance about the restriction on use of unmanned aerial vehicles and drones over Jagannath Temple,\" superintendent of police (Puri) Sarthak Sarangi told TOI. Jagannath Temple stands amongst one of the highly sensitive shrines in the country. In 2014, an unidentified foreign tourist created quite a flutter when he uploaded aerial photos and videos of the temple on social networking sites. Sensing aerial threat to the temple, the district administration then imposed ban on flying of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles above Jagannath Temple. However, the administration has not laid down any penal provision for violation of the order. Police continued to remain on their toes as devotees managed to take their cameras and mobile phones inside the shrine and clicked photographs and selfies. The selfies taken by devotees kept hitting the social media, raising question mark on the security frisking at the four entrances of Jagannath Temple. According to Section 30-A (4-C) of Jagannath Temple Act 1953, devotees cannot take camera into the shrine. Violation of the Act is a punishable offence and attracts imprisonment up to two months and Rs 1,000 fine. But police have so far not registered any case as the temple administration never lodged any complaint. Temple body said they only imposed fine on violators. Last week, the district administration rescued a Russian tourist, who was found begging outside Jagannath Temple.','CITY-BHUBANESWAR','Debabrata Mohapatra','2017-12-14 18:05:00','| TNN | Dec 14, 2017, 18:05 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:55'),(441,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/varsity-to-rename-hostels-after-literary-works-of-gangadhar-meher/articleshow/62066458.cms','Varsity to rename hostels after literary works of Gangadhar Meher','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62066454,width-400,resizemode-4/62066454.jpg]','SAMBALPUR: The Gangadhar Meher University (GMU) will rechristen three womens hostels of the institution.

It will come up under the project of City Gas Distribution (CGD) project implemented by the GAIL (India) Limited, a government-owned natural gas transmission company. Citys like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai have these facilities before. Ashutosh Karnatak, director (projects) of GAIL (India) Limited, told media persons here that two more stations are being constructed at Khandagiri and Tamando in the city. \"We are planning to build 15 similar stations in Bhubaneswar and 10 others at Cuttack in phase wise to promote the use of CNG,\" he added. He said overall expenditure for the twin city CGD projects will be Rs 1700 crore. The company is planning to spend Rs 400 crore in twin city in next three to five years, he added. The officer said CNG is one of the most environment-friendly fuels as compared to conventional ones due to lack of impurities such as sulphur or lead. \"It is safe because it is lighter than air and rises up in case of leakage. It is also economical than other fuels. We call it Happy Fuel because it is an economical, environment friendly, convenient and safer fuel,\" he added. He said 50 CNG-run auto rickshaws and 17 scooters will be launched in the city on Saturday. To avail the service, an owner has to convert his/her scooter into CNG mode, he added. According to GAIL India, the rate of 1 kg of CNG is Rs 59. \"A CNG-run scooter can run 80 km per one kg of this fuel. An Auto rickshaw can show a mileage of 120 km per 4 kg of CNG. A person can save 30 per cent in auto rickshaw and 50 per cent in scooter than the conventional fuels,\" said Karnatak. Initially, the company will bring natural gas to Bhubaneswar in special containers called as cascades by road from Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh. Later it will be supplied through the 2,655 km long Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra Natural Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL), which is known as Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga project. The minister will also lay foundation stone on Sunday for two gas pipelines- one new Dhamra-Angul main line and Bhubaneswar-Cuttack-Paradip spur line- to supply gas to the CGD project and other commercial purposes.

The Expenditure Finance Committee, under the Union ministry of finance, has prepared a proposal and the ministry of human resources development will send the proposal to the Union cabinet for its approval. The amount is exclusively for construction of permanent campuses for the six IITs. Another proposal for Rs 20,000 crore for providing other infrastructure facilities is being prepared, sources said. It is stipulated that once the amount is released the construction of permanent campuses should be completed by 2024. The Union government in 2015 and 2016 announced setting up of six IITs in the country and accordingly new IITs have come up in Palakkad in Kerala, Dharwad in Karnataka, Bhilai in Jharkhand, Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh, Goa and Jammu. All these institutions are functioning in transit campuses. Dharwad IIT is being housed in the campus of the Water and Land Management Institute (Walmi), 10kms off Dharwad on Pune-Bengaluru national highway adjacent to the High Court Bench. The Karnataka government has allotted 470 acres of land near Mummigatti-Kelgeri for construction of a permanent campus for IIT. The department of land records and survey along with Jalavahini Management Private Ltd has identified the boundary of the allotted land. The compound wall— five feet in height and 7.5km in length is being constructed at a cost of Rs 10 crore. Deputy commissioner S?B?Bommanahalli, who is the chairman of the IIT-Dharwad board, stated that the Union human resource development (HRD) department has floated a global tender for finalising the building design coming up at 470 acre land at Kelgeri and Mummigatti. The compound wall construction work is nearing completion. A sum of Rs 17 crore has been released by the Centre to the public works department for compound wall construction. The main campus of IIT-Dharwad will come up at an estimated cost of Rs 1,400 crore and HRD?minister Prakash Javadekar has assured of making this a green campus. NEW BATCH JOINS The second batch of students has enrolled and 120 students including 13 girls have taken admission. Accordingly, facilities have been enhanced at the transit campus at Walmi. Classrooms are being renovated and additional staff quarters and hostel rooms too have been given. A total of Rs 14 crore is being spent for the new works, the officials said. FACILITIES YET TO BE CREATED However, there is need to improve facilities at the transit campus keeping in view the arrival of another 2-3 batches of students in next three years. It will take a minimum of 5-7 years for the new campus to be fully ready and till then, the IIT will have to function from the transit campus. The Walmi, which trains farmers in management of water and land, does not have proper arrangement for safe drinking water supply. The campus does not have connection to get Malaprabha water which is supplied to the twin cities. Water is drawn from borewells, filtered with the help of a RO unit and supplied to the students and staff. Power supply will not be adequate when the new laboratories are set up. As of now, there is only one feeder from the rural area which provides power to the IIT. \"There is need for one more independent feeder,\" said an official. He said the pace of creating and infrastructure has been slow. \"For setting up an institution of IITs stature, the ambience and place provided is not up to the mark. The pace of creating infrastructure is very slow. We are pushing things, but it is not enough. There has been undue delay in getting materials for renovation. Approval of files by various agencies/ departments is taking much time,\" the official said. NEW DIRECTOR Professor P Sheshu of IIT-Mumbai has taken over as the new full time director of IIT-Dharwad. He will have his task cut out to put IIT Dharwad on firm footing. The pace of work on infrastructure development to facilitate the second batch has been pathetically slow. There is a need to construct two more floors on the main Walmi building, where the transit campus is located, to house classrooms and laboratories, a building for hostel to accommodate the second batch of students and ensure adequate supply of water and electricity.','CITY-HUBBALLI','','2017-12-16 14:00:00','TNN | Dec 16, 2017, 14:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:18:58'),(447,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/telangana-bjp-mla-booked-for-giving-hate-speech/articleshow/62089213.cms','Telangana BJP MLA booked for giving hate speech','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62094929,width-400,resizemode-4/62094929.jpg]','KALABURGAI: Yadigir police have registered a case against BJP MLA Raja Singh of Goshamahal in Telangana, who made a provocative speech that could inflame communal tensions at the Virat Hindu Samavesh convention in Yadagiri on Thursday evening.

Besides shelling out Rs 60,000 each, the youths collected Rs 1 lakh from each of the three elected representatives of the gram panchayat and raised some amount from villagers and bank. With the funds, they lifted water from Upper Tunga canal by laying 4.5km pipeline and digging a small canal to fill four tanks in the village. The water in these water bodies is being used for drinking and other purposes. Hullatti village, home to 4,000 people, was facing acute water crisis due to the lack of rain for the past three years. Borewells in the village had also gone dry with groundwater table dropping below 800 feet. The villagers had to trek 1-2km to get water from nearby villages. Meanwhile, a large quantity of water was flowing in the Upper Tunga canal near Makari village, and this prompted the youths to act. To meet the drinking water needs of the people and improve the groundwater table, the youths decided to divert water from the canal. They laid the pipeline and installed four submersible motors (12 HP capacity) for lifting the water. \"Three tanks have filled, while the fourth one is getting filled. The work has also helped water percolate into the ground, which has improved the groundwater table. Almost all borewells have been recharged now. We are getting groundwater at 150-200 feet depth,\" said Veeranagouda Bidari, president of Hullatti GP and one of the members of the team who contributed Rs 1 lakh for the project. Bharamappa Uppar, another member of the team said, that they initially had not thought of working on the project without any government aid. \"But the collective enthusiasm of the team and villagers has made us achieve this. \"Now, we are getting sufficient water for drinking and other purposes. We are also getting sufficient water from boarwells for agriculture,\" he pointed out. Another member, Channabasappa Angadi said that repeated pleas to the government and elected representatives did not yield any result. \"They did not heed us even when there was huge quantity of water was flowing near the village,\" he said.

Relations between Beijing and Seoul have encountered their own rough patch over the US militarys deployment of a powerful anti-missile defence system in the South to counter the Norths threats. Moon hopes to \"normalise\" ties during the visit, his office has said, after Beijing imposed economic measures against South Korean companies, a move seen as retaliation to the installation of the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system. China sees the deployment as a threat to its own security. Moving past the disagreement has become increasingly important amid growing concern that bellicose rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang could spark war on the Korean peninsula. \"The highlights to watch of the visit would be whether the two sides (Seoul and Beijing) can start a dialogue and cooperation mechanism on the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear issue,\" said Zhu Feng, international studies professor at Peking University. China has long refused to countenance the possibility that the Norths Communist regime could collapse. But a series of nuclear and missile tests combined with pressure from US President Donald Trump has pushed Beijing to reconsider its position and prioritise improving relations with Seoul. \"It is a very uncertain period,\" Zhu said. \"The two sides need high-level dialogues and dialogues between militaries. These dialogues cannot really start without the normalisation of the bilateral relations.\" Moons visit comes after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was ready to talk to North Korea \"without preconditions\", though it remains determined to force Pyongyang to give up its nuclear arsenal. China and Russia responded positively to Tillersons remarks, even after the White House appeared to put his proposal in question by saying Trumps \"views on North Korea have not changed.\" Beijing has pressed for talks to peacefully resolve the crisis, but there are signals that it has begun to prepare for the possibility of the Norths collapse. Tillerson said Tuesday that US and Chinese officials have discussed scenarios in case the North Korean regime falls, including steps to deal with refugees crossing the border, and how to secure Pyongyangs nuclear weapons. Washingtons top diplomat said these discussions involved him, the US defence secretary and military chief, and senior Chinese officials. Such discussions were unthinkable just a few months ago.

Relations between Australia and China became strained in recent weeks after Canberra said it would ban foreign political donations as part of a crackdown aimed at preventing external influence in domestic politics, sharpening the focus on Chinas soft power. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull singled out China as he said foreign powers were making \"unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process\" in Australia. In response, China summoned Ambassador Jan Adams to a meeting at the Chinese Ministry for Foreign Affairs on December 8 to lodge a complaint, the source said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang confirmed the ministry had an \"important discussion\" with the Australian ambassador. \"The Australian side should be very clear about Chinas position on the relevant issue,\" Lu told a daily news briefing, without elaborating. Chinas Foreign Ministry said last week Turnbulls allegations were full of prejudice against China, were baseless and poisoned the atmosphere of China-Australia relations. Turnbulls allegations have been criticised by Australias opposition Labor Party as showing an \"anti-China\" bias that could jeopardise bilateral trade. China, which is easily Australias biggest trading partner, bought A$93 billion ($70 billion) worth of Australian goods and services last year. Australias unshakeable security relationship with the United States, however, has limited how cosy it gets with China. Turnbull denied indulging in anti-Chinese rhetoric, insisting Labour was using the issue to win favour with a large voter block ahead of a make-or-break by-election on Saturday that analysts said will determine his political future. \"I am disappointed they have tried to turn Australians against each other,\" Turnbull told reporters in Sydney.','WORLD-CHINA','','2017-12-14 15:29:00','Reuters | Dec 14, 2017, 15:29 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:09'),(465,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-fumes-over-potential-us-navy-visits-to-taiwan/articleshow/62071322.cms','China fumes over potential US navy visits to Taiwan','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62071619,width-400,resizemode-4/62071619.jpg]','BEIJING: China said it lodged an official protest with the United States after President Donald Trump signed a defence budget that opens the possibility for US warships to visit self-ruled Taiwan on Thursday. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lu Kang charged that the legislation, while non-binding, violates the One-China policy and \"constitutes an interference in Chinas domestic affairs\". \"We firmly oppose any form of official exchanges or military links between Taiwan and the US, as well as US arms sales to Taiwan,\" Lu told a regular news briefing. \"We hope that the US can fully grasp the damaging nature\" of the legislations Taiwan clause, he said. Trump on Tuesday signed the budget, which includes a clause saying the United States should \"consider the advisability and feasibility of re-establishing port of call exchanges between the United States navy and the Taiwan navy\". Chinese media reported last week that a diplomat from the Chinese embassy in the United States had warned that Beijing would take Taiwan back by force the day that a US warship enters a Taiwanese port. The island has been a thorny issue in China-US relations, as Trump began his transition into office by taking a precedent-breaking phone call from Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen. Trump mended ties by vowing to uphold the One-China policy shortly before Chinese President Xi Jinpings visit to his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort, but infuriated Beijing again this summer by approving a USD 1.3 billion arms sale to Taiwan. China and Taiwan split after a civil war in 1949, and while Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign nation, it has never formally declared independence. Beijing says Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory and will be brought back into the fold at some point.','WORLD-CHINA','','2017-12-14 19:33:00','AFP | Updated: Dec 14, 2017, 19:33 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:09'),(466,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-fails-to-block-un-meeting-on-north-korea-human-rights/articleshow/62025519.cms','China fails to block UN meeting on North Korea human rights','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62025548,width-400,resizemode-4/62025548.jpg]','UNITED NATIONS, UNITED STATES: China on Monday failed to block a meeting on North Koreas human rights crisis at the UN Security Council.

The \"One Belt One Road\" is a maze of projects meant to connect China with Asia, Europe and Africa. \"It is not our intent to contain Chinas economic growth. They must grow. They still have hundreds of millions of people that need to move out of poverty. But we do pay close attention to their OBOR policy,\" Tillerson told the State Department employees in a town hall. The OBOR strategy articulates the Chinese view of their future of how theyre going to grow their economy, and how theyre going to protect that economic growth, and perhaps extend some of their own spheres of influence around the world, he noted. The Secretary of State borrowed a quote from Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, \"China has One Belt, One Road; the United States and the global economy has many belts and many roads, and no one country gets to choose the belt or the road.\" \"Its part of the global order, the international system of rules and norms. China can choose to carry out its OBOR within that system, or it can try to redefine that. And thats what a lot of the discussion between us is about: How are we going to live together? How are both of us going to be prosperous together?\" the top US diplomat sought to know. China, he said, has been cooperating on North Korea, but it needs to do more. \"In some respects, it was a good way to start this new administrations relationship with China because it gave us something of a shared objective from the very beginning to pursue. And they were very open to hearing our approach and have been supportive in that regard,\" he said. Trump administrations engagement with China kicked off with the visit of President Xi Jinping to the US Presidents Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. Now there are four dialogues with China: diplomatic and security dialogue, economic and trade dialogue, law enforcement and cyber security dialogue, and people-to-people dialogue. \"All four of these high-level dialogues met throughout the year and reported out the status of those discussions and President Trumps recent state visit to Beijing. Our message to the Chinese in these dialogues was these need to be results-based dialogues, not just meet and talk. We have to produce something that moves this relationship forward,\" Tillerson said. These dialogues, he said, are serving very important purposes because behind all of these discussions is trying to understand what is going to define the US-China relationship for the next half century. \"How are we going to live together, two great powers with great peoples that need to be - have needs that need to be served? So thats framing much of the China policy in our engagement, and obviously, there are significant national security issues,\" he said. The Secretary of State said relationship with China has been pretty well defined since the opening of China with Nixons historic visit over the past many years with the \"One China\" policy, the commitment to the three communiques, and it did - it has led to a period of calm, prosperity as Chinas economy has grown. \"All of us have benefited globally with Chinas economic growth. But now, a lot of things have kind of gotten out of balance, as you well know,\" he said. \"The dialogue were having with the Chinese today is okay, that worked for the last 40 to 50 years, but China is in a different place now. You are in many respects still a developing nation because you have millions of people that are yet to move out of poverty and to middle class status, but youre not the developing China of the Nixon era. Youre in a different place today and were in a different place,\" he said. On the South China Sea, Tillerson said it is one area where the two countries hold significant differences and that they have to deal with it. \"Chinas continued building of these structures in the South China Sea in territories that are disputed - others lay claim to - and then further militarising those structures is a very serious issue that we talk about routinely,\" he said. Tillerson noted that the contentious South China Sea issue is \"a concern to many of our allies and trading partners in the Southeast Asia region.\" China claims almost all of the South China Sea but Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over the waterway.','WORLD-CHINA','','2017-12-13 17:04:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 13, 2017, 17:04 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:12'),(468,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/as-tensions-ease-china-keeps-building-on-disputed-islands/articleshow/62085056.cms','While focus is on North Korea, Beijing continues South China Sea buildup','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62085266,width-400,resizemode-4/62085266.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/62085265/Master.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Tensions over Chinas island-building in the South China Sea may have eased in the past year, but Beijing has kept busy. New satellite imagery shows China has built infrastructure covering 72 acres (28 hectares) in the Spratly and Paracel islands during 2017 to equip its larger outposts to be air and naval bases. The Washington-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative closely tracks developments in the South China Sea, where China and several Asian governments have conflicting territorial claims. It said on Thursday there has been construction of hangars, underground storage, missile shelters, radar arrays and other facilities. The activity comes as China joins what are likely to be protracted negotiations with Southeast Asian nations on a \"code of conduct\" for South China Sea. Tensions with the US on the issue have also eased, despite Washingtons criticism of Beijings conduct. The construction is the follow-up phase to a campaign of land reclamation that was completed by early 2016 in the Spratlys, an island chain where Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam and Brunei also have claims. According to the Pentagon, China has added more than 3,200 acres (1,248 hectares) of land to the seven land features it occupies in the area. China also seems to have halted smaller-scale operations to expand islands in the Paracels that lie farther north, the initiative said. Construction shown on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands the disputed South China Sea (SIS/AMTI DigitalGlobe/Handout via Reuters) The US and others have accused Beijing of further militarizing the region and altering geography to bolster its sweeping claims across the South China Sea. China says the man-made islands in the Spratlys, which are equipped with airstrips and military installations, are mainly for civilian purposes and to boost safety for fishing and maritime trade. Greg Poling, the initiatives director, said China had seized a diplomatic opening after the election of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who adopted a conciliatory stance toward Beijing over their territorial dispute. Its also been less of a focus for President Donald Trumps administration, preoccupied by North Koreas nuclear threat and trade disputes with China. \"Its gotten off the front pages, but we shouldnt confuse that with a softening in Chinas pursuit of its goals. They are continuing all the construction they want,\" Poling said. The most construction has been on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratlys, including hangars alongside its 10,000-foot (3,000-meter) airstrip, underground structures likely intended to house munitions or other materiel, hardened shelters for missile platforms, and communication and radar facilities, the initiative said. It also noted that China has deployed new military aircraft at Woody Island in the Paracels. At the end of October, the Chinese military released images of J-11B fighter planes there for drills. In mid-November, Y-8 transport aircraft were spotted on the same island that may be capable of electronic intelligence gathering. Marine Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday that he could not comment in detail on US assessments of the region but that \"further militarization of outposts will only serve to raise tensions and create greater distrust among claimants.\" The United States does not claim territory in the South China Sea but has declared it has a national interest in ensuring that the territorial disputes there are resolved peacefully in accordance with international law and that freedom of navigation and overflight are guaranteed. China has opposed what it calls US meddling in an Asian dispute.','WORLD-CHINA','','2017-12-15 18:07:00','AP | Updated: Dec 15, 2017, 18:07 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:14'),(469,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/work-on-3-cpec-projects-halted-till-chinas-nod-pak-minister/articleshow/62040075.cms','Work on 3 CPEC projects halted pending Chinas approval: Pakistan minister','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62040073,width-400,resizemode-4/62040073.jpg]','ISLAMABAD: China has halted the release of funds for three key projects under the $50 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) till Beijing revised its financial mechanism, said a media report on Tuesday quoting minister for planning and development Ahsan Iqbal. The minister informed a parliamentary committee meeting on the CPEC that the Chinese side was reviewing the financial mechanism of these projects and work on them would restart after receiving approval from Beijing, Dawn newspaper quoted a press release by the National Assembly secretariat as saying. The CPEC is a planned network of roads, railways and energy projects linking Chinas resource-rich Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with Pakistans strategic Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea. The CPEC was launched in 2015 when President Xi Jinping visited Pakistan and it now envisages investment of over $50 billion in different projects of development in Pakistan. Iqbal could not convince the committee members as to why the Chinese government had opted for a new financial mechanism and scrapped the previous one which was agreed upon by both countries, the report said. It was reported that China had temporarily stopped funding some projects, particularly those related to the road network under CPEC, till a further decision on new guidelines by Beijing. The decision by the Chinese government is likely to hit over 1 trillion Pakistani rupees worth of road projects of the Pakistans National Highway Authority (NHA), the Dawn had reported last week. The report had said that China decided to temporarily stop funding at least three major road projects in Pakistan under the CPEC following reports of alleged corruption. Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Asad Umar, who is also a member of the parliamentary committee, said the meeting was informed that China was revising the infrastructure projects under its \"financial review\". Another member of the committee, Al-Haj Gul Khan Afridi, said they were told that China had not stopped financing the CPEC projects but raised some \"technical objections\" to three NHA road projects. A team of Chinese experts would arrive in Pakistan soon to inspect the three projects by the National Highway Authority (NHA), he added. The road projects that are likely to be affected include 210 km Dera Ismail Khan-Zhob Road, the 110 km Khuzdar-Basima Road and the 136 km Karakarom Highway from Raikot to Thakot. However, a senior NHA official rejected the government claim that work on the three road projects of the authority had been halted on technical grounds. \"It is not true that China raised objections to the projects because these had already been approved at the 6th Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting held last year,\" he said. Iqbal informed the committee that the Karachi Circular Railway project had been approved for the CPEC, while similar projects for Quetta and Peshawar would be reviewed in accordance with the technical feasibility reports.','WORLD-CHINA','','2017-12-12 19:21:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 12, 2017, 19:21 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:14'),(470,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-choose-living-buddhas-to-curb-dalai-lama-influence/articleshow/62058421.cms','Chinese choose Living Buddhas to curb Dalai Lama influence','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62058427,width-400,resizemode-4/62058427.jpg]','BEIJING: In the 10 years since the Chinese government stepped into the business of choosing Living Buddhas in Tibetan Buddhism, the state administration for religious affairs (SARA) has approved and provided training to 60 Living Buddhas. Its purpose is to counter the influence of the Dalai Lama over monks and Living Buddhas of different sections in Tibetan Buddhism, a senior official said. \"The rule has successfully prevented the Dalai Lama from using the reincarnation of Living Buddha to conduct activities that threaten Tibetan Buddhism and national unity,\" Zhu Weiqun, chairman of the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conferences Ethnic and Religious Affairs Committee told official media. \"Some Buddhist temples from some random area often appoint so-called Living Buddhas to serve their own purposes, and some people have been found to be using the guise of Living Buddha to swindle followers,\" Zhu added. The search for a Living Buddha takes place after the death of the leader of a Tibetan sect. There were 1,300 approved Living Buddhas in China in 2016, according to estimates drawn up by the government owned media. Seven more Living Buddhas below the age of 16 are undergoing training which includes education on issues like patriotism and the socialist political system practised by the Communist Party. China has replaced the earlier practice which involved senior members of a Tibetan sect selecting and approving a Living Buddha to lead them. Tibetan monks are known to use wills, predictions or other clues such as dreams, divination, omens and celestial observations to determine a new Living Buddha after one of them dies. The succession of a living Buddha is now carried out under the guidance of government backed Buddhist associations and religious groups who are expected to see that the process conforms to religious ritual and historical convention. The China Buddhist Association is expected to report to SARA in case there is a conflict in the process of succession. This happens when more than one Living Buddha emerges in a sect and their respective families get into a quarrel, officials said. The succession must be approved by departments of religious affairs or governments above municipal level. Zhu also said that the regulation has institutionalized the Chinese governments management of the reincarnation of living Buddhas, and gives the government decisive rights on the matter. SARA says in its website that government rules have helped protect peoples religious freedom, maintained the normal order of Tibetan Buddhism and helped to build a harmonious society. \"During the past 10 years, every living Buddhas incarnate was found and approved according to the regulation, and is completely in accordance with the status quo of Tibetan Buddhism and Buddhists wishes,\" Global Times quoted Dawa Tsering, a monk and president of the Buddhism Association of Shannan City of Tibet as saying.','WORLD-CHINA','Saibal Dasgupta','2017-12-14 11:20:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 14, 2017, 11:20 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:15'),(471,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/poisoned-syringes-fired-at-pet-dogs-for-china-meat-trade/articleshow/62053440.cms','Poisoned syringes fired at pet dogs for China meat trade','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62053706,width-400,resizemode-4/62053706.jpg]','SHANGHAI: Poisoned syringes that could be fired at dogs on the street to kill them instantly were sold by a gang in China, allowing pets to be snatched and sold for the dinner table, state media said.

Over 1 million poor people in India are involved in manual recycling operations, but \"most of these people have very low literacy levels with little awareness of the dangers of the operations,\" it added. The dangers come from \"improper and unsafe treatment and disposal through open burning or in dumpsites,\" the report said. The report, Global E-waste Monitor 2017, said that domestically India produced 1.95 million tonnes of e-waste last year -- or about 1.5 kg per person -- and it also imports it from developed countries. E-waste includes a whole variety of small and large appliances, and electronic equipment including cell phones, TVs, refrigerators, air conditioners, computers and lamps, small appliance and large appliances, lamps. Last year, the world produced 44.7 million tonnes of e-waste or 6.1 kg per person, which is four times more than the e-waste produced by each Indian. Only 8.9 million tonnes -- or 20 per cent -- per cent of total global e-waste was recycled, it noted. The report estimated that the value of recoverable precious materials like gold, silver, copper, platinum and palladium contained in last years e-waste was $55 billion and much of it was going to waste. A formal e-waste recycling sector is now being developed in major Indian cities and under the countrys rules producers have extended responsibility for the handling the waste that ultimately results from their products, the report said. The main features of the regulations are a refundable deposit scheme that incentivises recycling and parallel to that is the creation of Producer Responsibility Organisations to handle the waste, it said. Looking ahead, the report said that the problem could become more acute with cheaper cell phones and other equipment becoming available. \"This means that more people will be able to afford purchasing new equipment, and that more equipment will eventually be discarded,\" it added pointing to the need for developing systems to safely handle the e-waste and recycle it.','HOME-ENVIRONMENT','','2017-12-14 11:07:00','IANS | Dec 14, 2017, 11:07 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:20'),(474,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/us-might-place-atlantic-sea-turtle-on-endangered-list/articleshow/62043628.cms','US might place Atlantic sea turtle on endangered list','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62043703,width-400,resizemode-4/62043703.jpg]','PORTLAND: Federal wildlife officials say they are reviewing the status of a sea turtle that lives in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean to see if it should be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

Though the environment ministry has, so far, not amended its December, 2015 notification which sought these polluting power plants to retrofit emission control equipments by December 7 this year, it aligned itself with the demand of the power ministrys Central Electricity Authority (CEA) while submitting its fresh views on the issue in the Supreme Court on Wednesday. The move may now allow over 300 such plants across the country, including those in the NCR, to continue to emit toxic sulphur dioxide (SOx) and oxide of nitrogen without any obligation to adhere to stricter emission norms till December, 2022. Surprisingly, the environment ministry by doing so even overlooked the stand of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) which had in 2015 found the two-year time period sufficient for thermal power plants (TPPs) to retrofit necessary equipments. The ministry had, in fact, notified the new standards and set the time-frame after taking views of all stakeholders including TPPs. Citing \"practical difficulties\" highlighted by the power ministry, the environment ministry, however, now told the Court that since uninterrupted power supply in the country needs to be ensured at all times, it has to be done in phases to avoid problem in the power supply as many units cannot be taken out for retrofitting at the same time. The CEA had, in fact, argued on the same line and sought extension of deadline for installation of necessary equipments to control emissions up to December, 2022 - five years more than what the TPPs had agreed in 2015. Taking note of the ministrys stand, the SC on Wednesday proposed to take up the issue on the next date of hearing on February 1, 2018 and requested the environment lawyer Ritwik Dutta to be present there and assist the Court. \"It is unfortunate that the environment ministry, in its submission to the SC, has supported the position of the power ministry to delay the implementation of new emissions standards for TPPs. These standards were notified in 2015 and were scheduled for implementation by December 2017. But now, the government has appealed for further extension till 2022. This is unacceptable,\" said Sunita Narain, environmentalist and director general of the Delhi-based think-tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). In its implementation plan for the TPPs, located in the NCR or nearby, the CEA told the environment ministry that the Mahatma Gandhi TPP at Jhajjar would be retrofitted with necessary equipment by January, 2019 while the same would be done at Panipat (2x250 MW) TPP by April, 2021. Similarly, the public sector power company NTPCs plant at Dadri would be retrofitted with new equipment by next 18 months. The CEA had, in fact, submitted its implementation plan for all TPPs across the country and sought time till December, 2022 for installation of Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) for SOx control and other pollution control equipment. The environment ministry had in December 2015 notified the revised standards for all these coal-based thermal power plants. The new standards, based on the recommendation of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), are aimed at reducing emission of PM10, sulphur dioxide and oxide of nitrogen which will, in turn, help in bringing about an improvement in the Ambient Air Quality (AAQ). The CSE has estimated that the power sector alone contributes 60 per cent of the PM (particulate matter), 45 per cent of sulphur dioxide, 30 per cent of nitrogen oxides and 80 per cent of mercury emissions of the total emissions from the industrial sector.','HOME-ENVIRONMENT','Vishwa Mohan','2017-12-15 22:11:00','| TNN | Dec 15, 2017, 22:11 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:22'),(476,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/no-paris-climate-accord-no-problem-says-bloc-of-states/articleshow/62073569.cms','No Paris climate accord?

More than a dozen formed an alliance committed to reducing emissions in line with the Paris accord, an international agreement that aims to halt the rise in global temperatures. Several state leaders, including California Gov. Jerry Brown, were in Paris this week for a climate summit two years after the historic accord was signed. The summit offered updates on promised funding for poor countries to address climate change, the latest research on ways to cut emissions as well as the corporate worlds response to the problem. Others, wanting to be more ambitious, are taking a look at the countrys only regional program that mandates emission reductions in the power sector. Known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, it covers nine states in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic and is poised to expand. \"The clear signal from the Trump administration that they were going to pull back on environmental policy throws it back at the states and says, `OK, its your game, said William Shobe, a professor of public policy at the University of Virginia. \"A number of states are responding, saying, `OK, were up to that and were going to go ahead and implement policy. The program sets limits on power plant emissions and requires them to purchase allowances equal to the amount of those emissions. Money raised through those allowances at quarterly auctions goes back to the states. The only other program of its kind is in California, which covers the states entire economy. It linked up with Quebecs cap-and-trade program in 2014 and will expand to include Ontarios next year. Since it began in 2008, RGGI has led to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent in the states stretching from Maine to Maryland, 16 percent more than other states without emissions programs. The program has also sent $2.8 billion back to the states, money that has funded a range of environmental programs, including energy efficiency upgrades at a middle school and library in Massachusetts, expansion of solar power in New York, and green measures at a brewery in New Hampshire. \"Young consumers dont have any patience for companies that are not consciously involved in reducing their footprint and their impact on the planet. I think that runs pretty deep, said Peter Egelston, as he led a tour of his Smuttynose Brewing Co. in Hampton, whose facility includes solar tubes that allow more natural light into the brewery and a high-tech milling system that gets more yield out of the malted barley. Since the November elections, Virginia announced it is taking steps to become the first Southern state to join the regional cap-and-trade program, while New Jersey has promised to rejoin the pact. If they get on board, member states would represent a combined gross domestic product of $3.9 trillion, which if they were a country would displace Germany as the fourth-largest economy, according to the Acadia Center, a nonprofit that promotes clean energy. Virginias climate strategy, approved last month, would limit emissions from most power plants starting in 2020, followed by a 30 percent reduction over a decade. Eligible carbon emitters would have to participate in the regional greenhouse gas program. \"We do not have the luxury of waiting for Washington to wake up to this threat we must act now, Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe said in a statement. New Jersey is set to rejoin the regional program when Democratic Governor elect Phil Murphy takes office Jan. 16, succeeding GOP Gov. Chris Christie, who pulled the state out of the regional agreement, arguing it drove up electricity costs. Still, RGGI has its doubters, many who contend its success has more to do with the changing energy landscape than government regulations. They argue the nine states were already switching from coal-fired to natural gas power plants when they joined the program which, according to a Duke University study , was responsible for a third of the reductions. Several states also instituted renewable energy goals that led to a shift toward wind, solar and hydro power that reduce emissions. Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group founded by billionaire Koch brothers, said the program has offered very few benefits and that such models cant solve the climate problem. It has called for New Hampshire to pull out and opposes New Jersey rejoining. \"Our view is that RGGI and other ideologically driven energy policies cause energy prices to go up, which disproportionally impacts the poor, said Levi Russell, an Americans For Prosperity spokesman. Still, supporters say the program has been a force for good reducing emissions and improving air quality without hurting economic growth. And with its emission cap set to become more stringent in 2020, said Dallas Burtraw, a senior fellow at the research institution Resources For The Future, RGGI could be even more ambitious than Obamas signature climate plan if ever went national. Obamas Clean Power Plan called for cutting emission in the power sector by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. It was put on hold by the Supreme Court and is being scrapped by Trump. \"We have a great success story to tell, said Katie Scharf Dykes, who chairs the RGGI board and the Connecticut public utilities agency. \"At this moment, this story is more relevant than ever before.','HOME-ENVIRONMENT','','2017-12-14 22:30:00','AP | Dec 14, 2017, 22:30 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:23'),(477,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/worlds-space-agencies-propose-setting-up-climate-observatory/articleshow/62036230.cms','Worlds space agencies propose setting up climate observatory','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62036294,width-400,resizemode-4/62036294.jpg]','PARIS: The heads of several of the worlds space agencies have proposed the creation of a climate observatory to pool acquired data and share it with scientists around the globe, according to a declaration adopted in Paris.

North Atlantic right whales are among the rarest marine mammals in the world, and they have endured a deadly year. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said there are only about 450 of the whales left and 17 of them have died so far in 2017. The situation is so dire that American and Canadian regulators need to consider the possibility that the population wont recover without action soon, said John Bullard, the Northeast Regional Administrator for NOAA Fisheries. The high year of mortality is coinciding with a year of poor reproduction, and there are only about 100 breeding female North Atlantic right whales left. \"You do have to use the extinction word, because thats where the trend lines say they are,\" Bullard said. \"Thats something we cant let happen.\" Bullard and other NOAA officials made the comments during a Tuesday meeting of the regulatory New England Fishery Management Council. Mark Murray-Brown, an Endangered Species Act consultant for NOAA, said right whales have been declining in abundance since 2010, with females hit harder than males. The US and Canada must work to reduce the human-caused deaths of the whales, Murray-Brown said. Vessel-strikes and entanglement in fishing gear are two frequently cited causes of the whales deaths.','HOME-ENVIRONMENT','','2017-12-10 21:28:00','AP | Dec 10, 2017, 21:28 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:26'),(480,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/cheetahs-should-be-listed-as-endangered-said-scientists/articleshow/62053261.cms','Cheetahs should be listed as endangered: Scientists','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62053302,width-400,resizemode-4/62053302.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Cheetahs, one of the planets most iconic big cats, should be listed as \"endangered\", according to scientists who have found evidence of low cheetah population estimates in southern Africa. A comprehensive assessment of cheetah populations prompted the researchers to support the call for uplisting of cheetahs from \"vulnerable\" to \"endangered\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. The study revealed that only 3,577 adult cheetahs remain in southern Africa. This estimate is 11 percent lower than the IUCNs current assessment. With partial support from the National Geographic Society, researchers analysed more than two million collared cheetah observations. Their findings showed that free-ranging cheetahs were present across about 789,700 square kilometres in Namibia, Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe between 2010 and 2016. \"This is the area with the largest population of free- ranging cheetahs left on Earth. Knowing how many cheetahs there are and where they occur is crucial for developing suitable conservation management plans for the species,\" said Varsha Vijay, from the Duke University in the US. According to the study published in the journal Peer J, 49.7 per cent farmers consider cheetahs a source of conflict, while only a minority of farmers (26.5 percent) actively persecute (eg, kill or trap) the species. \"The future of the cheetah relies heavily on working with farmers who host these big cats on their lands, bearing the heaviest cost of coexistence,\" said Florian Weise of the Claws Conservancy. The study not only estimated the number of cheetahs in areas with confirmed sightings, but also identified places where it is possible for cheetahs to live but where they have not been recently observed. \"To better understand this rare and elusive species, we need to complement the monitoring of confirmed populations with the investigation of possible cheetah habitat,\" said Vijay.','HOME-ENVIRONMENT','','2017-12-13 16:39:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 13, 2017, 16:39 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:26'),(481,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/marine-organisms-shred-plastic-bags-into-microscopic-pieces/articleshow/62006621.cms','Marine organisms shred plastic bags into microscopic pieces','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62006790,width-400,resizemode-4/62006790.jpg]','LONDON: A single plastic grocery bag could be shredded by marine organisms into over one million microscopic fragments, a study has found. Marine scientists at the University of Plymouth examined the rate at which bags were broken down by the amphipod Orchestia gammarellus, which inhabits coastal areas in northern and western Europe. The results show that marine wildlife are actually contributing to the spread of microplastics within the marine environment, rather than them simply being emitted from the water supply or forming through the physical and chemical break down of larger items. Their main aim was to discover whether different types of plastic and the presence of a biofilm - a layer of organic material which accumulates over time - altered the rate at which such organisms broke down plastic debris. Through monitoring in the laboratory and on the shoreline, researchers demonstrated the bags were torn and stretched by Orchestia gammarellus, with microplastics subsequently being found in and around their faecal matter. The type of plastic - conventional, degradable and biodegradable - had no effect on the rate of ingestion, however the presence of a biofilm meant the shredding took place around four times as quickly. This is consistent with recent studies into the feeding behaviour of seabirds and suggests marine life might be increasingly attracted to marine debris as a source of food regardless of the potential harm caused. \"An estimated 120 million tonnes of single use plastic items - such as carrier bags - are produced each year and they are one of the main sources of plastic pollution,\" said Richard Thompson, from the University of Plymouth. \"They already represent a potential hazard to marine life, but this research shows species might also be contributing to the spread of such debris,\" Thompson said. \"It further demonstrates that marine litter is not only an aesthetic problem but has the potential to cause more serious and persistent environmental damage,\"','HOME-ENVIRONMENT','','2017-12-10 12:05:00','PTI | Dec 10, 2017, 12:05 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:27'),(482,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/only-2-47-students-requested-for-verification-of-marks-cbse/articleshow/59222756.cms','Only 2.47% students requested for verification of marks: CBSE','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59222786,width-400,resizemode-4/59222786.jpg]','NEW DELHI: Amid allegations of \"faulty evaluation process\" adopted for class XII exams, the CBSE on Monday clarified that it has received requests for verification of marks from only 2.47 per cent of the students.

While elucidating Mookerjees initiatives on education, Shah described him as a \"visionary leader\" who laid emphasis on the education system which is connected with the basic fundamentals of our society and promotes natural talent. \"Mookerjee emphasised on these two points specifically so that education can become a mass movement in the early years of independence as the literacy rate was very low then,\" the BJP president said. Mookerjee founded the right wing nationalist party Bharatiya Jana Sangh which later evolved as the BJP.

Lauding the BJP ideologues role in nation building, Shah rued that \"historians have not done justice with him\". Mookerjee saved Bengal by pushing for partition of the united Bengal before independence, otherwise the entire state would had become east Pakistan and later Bangladesh, he said.

The Delhi High Court has remarked that the Central Board of Secondary Educations (CBSE) examiners would also make mistakes or errors in totalling of marks and evaluation as was recently claimed in a news report. While the CBSE said the news report was sensationalising the issue, the Board has admitted that there was 0.021 per cent error in its evaluation of answer sheets of the 10 lakh students, who gave the class XII exams, which according to the high court meant that roughly the careers of 2,100 children would be at stake. Referring to recent news reports of totalling errors by the CBSE being brought out subsequent to the re-verification of marks, the high court had said errors in evaluation were also possible. In the wake of several petitions being moved by students, one even from Saudi Arabia, the high court has now called for the Boards governing body and the examination committees minutes of meeting that led to the decision to scrap the re- evaluation policy. The court said it would go through the minutes of the meeting \"to ascertain the rationale behind the decision\". It also asked the Board to bring its marking scheme for this years exams. Majority of the petitions that are before the court are by students who have scored extremely well in their exams running up to the Boards in which they have scored poorly or much below their expectations. Another student, Shruti Gupta, who has claimed to have topped in three of her five Humanities stream subjects in her school has now moved the high court challenging the scrapping of the re-evaluation policy. The student, who has managed to get a copy of her answer sheet of the Political Science exam, has alleged that she has been awarded zero marks in several questions and less marks in others, even though her answers are in consonance with the marking scheme of the Board and correct as per the NCERT textbook. In her plea, filed through advocate Gaurav Pathak, she has said that with the Delhi University cut-offs expected to be out any day and there being no clarity regarding her marks, she would not be able to apply to her preferred colleges. Just like the other students who have moved the Delhi High Court, she too has sought parity with the 150 students of Odisha whose class XII exam papers were directed by the Orissa High Court to be re-evaluated. The Orissa HC order had come after the CBSEs lawyer there had submitted that the re-evaluation policy was still in existence. However, before the Delhi High Court another CBSE lawyer said the statement made before the Orissa HC was incorrect and the Board is going to appeal against the order directing re- evaluation of the answer sheets. Thereafter, the Board told the Delhi High Court that it has mentioned its appeal before the Orissa HC which is likely to hear it soon.','HOME-EDUCATION','','2017-06-20 19:13:00','PTI | Jun 20, 2017, 19:13 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:34'),(486,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/maharashtra-board-class-x-results-girls-outperform-boys-yet-again/articleshow/59123577.cms','Maharashtra Board SSC class 10 results: Girls outperform boys yet again','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59123603,width-400,resizemode-4/59123603.jpg]','PUNE: Girls outshone boys yet again in the Maharashtra Boards class X examination results declared on Tuesday, by recording a better pass percentage.

World No. 3 Sindhu thus emulated Saina Nehwal, who had reached the final in 2011, and mixed doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and V Diju, who had ended runners-up in 2009. \"Overall, it was a very good quality match.

In the first game, Sindhu rode on the unforced errors of Chen, ranked eighth in the world, to quickly open up a 5-0 lead early on. Chen opened her account when Sindhu found the net and soon she drew parity with an accurate placement and superb return at the nets. Chen, who did not reach the finals of any Super Series tournament this season, punished Sindhu for putting the shuttle short at the mid-court and grabbed a 8-6 lead when the Indian again committed an error. With Chen going wide, Sindhu broke the rhythm and then unleashed a magnificent down-the-line smash to claw her way back at 8-8. Sindhu grabbed a 10-8 lead when the Chinese hit the net and wide. A long rally ensued which ended with Sindhu failing to reach for the shuttle at the forecourt. Another accurate return at the baseline and it was Chen who had made it 10-10 but she sent the shuttle out again as Sindhu enjoyed a slender 11-10 lead at the break. Chen found the going tough after the breather as she struggled to control the shuttle to hand Sindhu a 15-11 lead. The Chinese exploited Sindhus backhand forecourt with some beautiful backhand returns to make it 13-16 but Sindhu continued to gather points, producing some superb returns which her opponent could not negotiate. Chen defended a body smash from Sindhu but then again hit long as Sindhu grabbed five game points. The Indian sealed the game with an overhead return which Chen failed to reach. After the change of sides, Chen produced some measured smashes to draw early lead but Sindhu unleashed a cross court smash after the Chinese tripped at the forecourt to draw parity at 2-2. Using her height, the Indian reached the shuttle early and produced some sharp acute-angled returns to move ahead to 6-3. Sindhu then produced a backhand flick near the net to grab another point before miscuing a shot. Sindhu added extra power to her returns, forcing her rival to commit errors. At 5-9, Chen pocketed a couple of points before a steep crosscourt return took Sindhu to 10-7. She entered the lemon break when Chen went wide again. After the interval, Sindhu managed to extend the lead to 15-11 but she lost two video referrals after going long and wide. The duo engaged in another fierce rally which the Chinese closed out with a jump smash to draw parity at 15-15. Chen earned a slender lead with another superb return on Sindhus backhand but she sent the shuttle wide next. Sindhu was then handed a yellow card for misconduct after she failed to return to the court on time. The Indian then grabbed three points, one being a lucky net chord to reach 19-16. Chen narrowed the gap after winning a long rally which left Sindhu exhausted. The Indian found the net next but after a couple of unforced errors by the Chinese, Sindhu lifted her hands in the air in celebration.','SPORTS-BADMINTON','','2017-12-16 22:38:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 22:38 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:38'),(489,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/will-drs-make-its-debut-in-ipl-2018/articleshow/62092247.cms','Will DRS make its debut in IPL 2018?','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62093070,width-400,resizemode-4/62093070.jpg]','VIZAG: BCCIs scepticism for the Decision Review System (DRS) seems a thing of the past.

I was fortunate to be able to personally use this equipment and received the support of sports science at all stages on my road to the Olympics. \"Having experienced the benefits of leaving no stone unturned, I wanted to in turn make similar services available to my fellow athletes. In designing the Centre, I have kept in mind the needs of the elite athlete as much as I have those of the general user. I believe that making sports science easily accessible holds a key to our nations sporting future and am delighted and grateful for the support of the Sports Authority of India in bringing this particular Centre to life.\" \"When I retired I did not know for a long time what to do whereas Abhinav Bindra already knew what he wanted and this facility came up in double quick time. That is the difference between a Test batsman and a sharp shooter,\" Dravid said while praising Bindras effort.

The officials also pointed out that the BCCI rules only permitted Kings XI to play four of their home games in Mohali while they could play the rest of their home matches in some other venues. Kings had written to BCCI citing the lack of support from the Punjab Cricket Association and constant disagreements with the local authorities which has compelled them to demand this move. It is also understood that catering passes to the government officials from both Punjab and Haryana has also been a bone of contention for the team. Even the collections from sale of tickets werent good enough like the one in Pune, which had earlier prompted the Kings owner to shift their base from Mohali. With IPL GC finally deciding that the franchisee base cant be shifted out, the Kings would now have to rely on Mohali again this year.

The islanders three-match ODI series against hosts India is tied 1-1. \"Definitely, Vizag is similar to Sri Lanka when it comes to weather and stuff. Mohali and Dharamsala were completely different. It was a total different story. We are well prepared. Here I hope we will be able to do something special as this is something similar to what we find at home,\" he told reporters on the eve of the match. Perera said the team had a couple of training sessions and prepared well and they were taking it like just another game. \"We had a good couple of training sessions. We are well prepared for the game ahead,\" he added. About India being under pressure ahead of the final game, he said it is the best team in the world and could be under some sort of pressure. \"From our side we take it as just another game. Not thinking too much as to whether the series is at stake or whatever. We want to play just another game. India are the best team in the world and I am sure they will be under some sort of pressure,\" the Lanka skipper added. Perera said the team management had not finalised the playing XI as yet and said they would take a call after looking at the wicket tomorrow. \"We will take a look at the wicket and stick to a 12-man squad and decide tomorrow,\" he said. He played down the defeat in Mohali and the onslaught from India captain Rohit Sharma, backing his bowlers to bounce back. \"Our bowling didnt click and that was disappointing. But these things happen in cricket. We want to put that game aside and bounce back. We have some plans for Rohit and for Shikhar Dhawan and now it is up to our bowlers to execute those plans. We will see what happens tomorrow,\" Perera said. \"Mentally we are all prepared. That is why I said that these things happen in cricket. We will not repeat these mistakes. First match we won, then they bounced back and we want to put our mistakes to rest and bounce back again,\" the big-hitting all-rounder said. As for the pitch, he said, it looked a bit dry and expected it to be on the slower side. \"Took a look at the pitch, it looks to me a bit dry. Past matches there has been only one high scoring game. Today and yesterday theres been good sunshine and I am sure there will be turn and the wicket will be slow,\" the Lanka captain said. He said the plan was to take early wickets and capitalise on the batting line-up that was without Virat Kohli. It worked in Dharamsala but didnt in Mohali and expected the bowlers to deliver the goods in tomorrows game. \"If you see we took two early wickets in Dharamsala and that enabled us to put more pressure on the Indian side. Their middle and lower order all of a sudden was under pressure. Our plan in to take early wickets in the first 20 overs and that will help us to put pressure on the opposition,\" Perera said. \"We had a good chat yesterday. These things happen.

Leading goal scorer of the season, Spanish forward Ferran Corominas (45th minute) scored his eighth to give FC Goa the initial lead which was followed by a brilliant 26-yard finish from fellow Spaniard Manuel Lanzarote (45th) within a fraction of a second, assisted by the first goal scorer. The third goal for FC Goa came as an own goal from Pritam Kotal (84th) which was followed by Adrian Perez (85th) and Manuel Arana (88th) finding the net once each before the referee blew the final whistle. For Delhi, skipper Kalu Uche (65th) scored the lone goal. FC Goa thus went on top of the table with 12 points on the basis of superior goal difference while Delhi Dynamos remained on the ninth spot. Delhi initiated the proceedings of the match by kicking the ball from left flank to right but failed to penetrate inside the box, easily giving away the ball to the visitors. In the second minute, Delhi had a large shout appealing for penalty after FC Goa midfielder Ahmed Jahouh used his body to tackle opponent Jeroen Lumu. But the decision was eventually ruled in favour of the visitors by the referee. FC Goa, on the other hand gave away too much of their possession in the initial minute after failing to pass the ball to their target. However, the visitors came close to taking a lead in the 11th minute but a shot from winger Mandar Dessai from the 26-yard was denied by the crossbar. The later minutes in the first-half saw Kotal and Romeo Fernandes combining well and creating chance but failing to convert it into a goal. Delhis strong defence was exposed by the end of the first half when FC Goas Corominas took a shot from inside the box which was first saved by the opponent goalkeeper Sukhadev Patil but was later netted by the Spanish on the re-bound due to poor clearance and lack of appearance. Later, in no time, Lanzarote doubled the lead for FC Goa, after a home team player lost the ball which was struck from outside the box and finished in the top corner. FC Goa took a 2-0 lead heading to half-time. In the second half, FC Goa coach Sergio Lobera substituted Corominas to bring in debutant Perez. Delhi looked to keep the ball but again failed to find the crucial touch to impose threat on the opposition while FC Goa looked comfortable on the possession. However, in the later minutes, Delhi passed and combined well with Romeo providing a clean cross inside the box and Uche making no mistake to net the ball home. Delhi, after reducing the deficit, caused more troubles for themselves in the 66th minute after they were shortened to 10-man with Italian defender Gabriel Cichero handed a second yellow card for holding Mandar with his heels. The shortage of a player affected Delhi with Kotal gifting the third goal to FC Goa with his poor defence and lack of awareness about his goalkeepers position. Later, Perez and Arana scored one goal each in similar fashion dancing away from the sloppy Delhi defence and netting the ball past the goalkeeper. The dying minutes saw the hosts clearing and blocking the ball every time it entered their box.','SPORTS-FOOTBALL','','2017-12-16 22:47:00','IANS | Dec 16, 2017, 22:47 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:42'),(496,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/sri-lanka-in-india/3rd-odi-buoyant-india-eye-series-win-at-fortress-visakhapatnam/articleshow/62094340.cms','3rd ODI: Buoyant India eye series win at fortress Visakhapatnam','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62094366,width-400,resizemode-4/62094366.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/photo/42706777.gif]','VISAKHAPATNAM: An imposing line-up and an impeccable record in this port city make India the clear favourites as they seek to clinch another series win against Sri Lanka in the third and final one-day international on Sunday.

Sri Lanka, on the other hand, are seeking to win their first ever bilateral series in India, having lost eight and drawn one. ALSO READ: Angelo Mathews fit to fire for Sri Lanka Skipper Rohit Sharma led the fightback for India in Mohali with a superb double century, his third in ODIs after the team had been outplayed in the series opener in Dharamsala. Sharma and his men will look to ride the momentum after a big win in the second game and seal the series at the ACA-VDCA stadium. The Indian team has lost only once at the venue in the seven games played here (with one being washed out) and will hope to keep winning on what has generally been a high-scoring ground. Defeat in Dharamsala meant India cant overtake South Africa in the ICC ODI rankings but a series win is at stake. Rohit & Co will look to maintain supremacy over the visiting Lankans, having won the Test series earlier. The India captain will look to continue the good work and domination of the Lankan attack while the other batsmen will also hope to be among runs. After being shot out for 112 in Dharamshala, the host batting line-up regained its mojo as Rohit led from the front. With Shikhar Dhawan chipping in with a half-century and the young Shreyas Iyer announcing himself on the big stage with a knock of 88 in the second ODI, the Indian batting seems to be back in form and would be expected to supply the runs in the series decider. Shreyas Iyer makes strong case for No. 4 slot 01:59 The top-orders performance could prove crucial for the home team if it has to continue its dominance. Also, the middle-order comprising Dinesh Karthik and Manish Pandey will love to be among the runs as would Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Hardik Pandya. It also looks like Ajinkya Rahane would remain on the sidelines unless the think-tank opts to pick him ahead of either Pandey or Karthik. The bowlers have looked the part so far and will aim to continue the good work on what is likely to be a batsman- friendly wicket, going by the records. And, the importance of bowling well in the first 10 overs cant be overemphasised and the lead bowlers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah would be well aware of this as would Lankas spearhead Suranga Lakmal. The visitors, buoyed by news about the availability of ace all-rounder Angelo Mathews for the crucial game, will be give it their all to snatch a much-needed series win, in what has been a tough year for them. Mathews scored a ton, albeit in a losing cause in Mohali and will be the lynchpin of the batting unit, which is short on experience, as the squad aims to secure a rare series win in India. The Lankans were brought crashing down to earth after a good win at Dharamsala as Rohit went on the rampage and their batsmen capitulated under the pressure of chasing a mammoth score. Mathews return to form must be heartening news for them as is the fact that he is bowling some overs, and with a degree of success too. Upul Tharanga, among the more experienced batsmen in the line-up, needs to step up and make a bigger contribution to the teams cause. The other batters including Lahiru Thirimanne, Danusha Gunathilaka and Niroshan Dickwella, have been inconsistent and will have to find ways to make sizeable scores. The bowers, on the other hand, will look to recover quickly from the horror show as Rohit turned on the heat. Nuwan Pradeep, who was taken for 106 in 10 overs, will look for redemption if he retains his place in the XI while Suranga Lakmal, the hero of the win at Dharamsala, holds the key for Lanka. Spinners of both teams havent had a great time in the ODIs and could be under pressure to keep the runs down in Visakhapatnam, where big scores have been the norm. While India are unlikely to tinker with the XI that won in Mohali, the visiting side may consider bringing the pacy Dushmantha Chameera in place of Pradeep. The last ODI played here against New Zealand, saw India romp home to a big win.

The Rohit-Dhawan combo has so far featured in 12 hundred-run opening partnerships and are only behind Sachin-Souravs 21. India were under pressure after the Dharamsala debacle and the duo punched back in style with a 115-run stand that set the game up brilliantly in the second ODI. Dhawan attributed the duos success to their attacking instincts. \"We have played together for a long time. Rohit is one of the best opening batsmen I have played with. Once Im set, I can demolish any side because thats my strength. And even Rohit, once he gets settled, scores big.

The ordinary performance in pace-friendly conditions has raised question marks ahead of the South Africa tour beginning early month when India go into the three-match Test series without playing a single warm-up game. \"We have learnt a lot of things. Especially when we played in Kolkata (during first Test against SL) and in Dharamsala (first ODI),\" said Dhawan ahead of the ODI series decider against Sri Lanka on Sunday. \"It was seaming and it was a damp wicket but we still went in with a positive intent and gave our best and of course, it didnt go our way but we all learnt from it. Its good sometimes when you fall, you learn a lot of things out of it,\" he added. India bounced back to level the series in Mohali courtesy a third double hundred from captain Rohit Sharma. India made a bagful of runs in the second ODI but Dhawan said there were still important learnings to take from the game. \"The way we came back in the next game, in Mohali we felt that it was a damp wicket at the start but it wasnt. Still the ball wasnt coming that nicely when we were batting at the start. \"We took the pressure nicely and changed the game after ten overs. As I said, its always a learning curve, we are learning and we are going to get better from here,\" the left- handed opener said. The southpaw was also all praise for his opening partner Rohit, who has led from the front in his first full series as captain. \"He has only been captain for two matches but Ive known Rohit from a long time and I know what his character is like. \"He is a very chilled out captain and tells us to keep the basics right, we all know our roles, we just have to give our best and hats off to him for the way he performed in the last game.

He is one of the best opening batsman I have played with.\" The stylish opener conceded that there is pressure ahead of the series decider tomorrow but the team is used to it. \"Of course there is pressure whenever you play a final (decider), there is pressure but we are used to it and there is going to be a big crowd tomorrow. \"We are a strong side and we believe in our ability and our skill, we are going to go out and play it like any other game, just do the basics right.\" At the same time, Dhawan expects the Sri Lankans to be better prepared after their loss in Mohali though the home team will be ready for the challenge. \"See of course, when you attack the opposition and the players we are, the calibre we have got once we are in. Once I am in, I can demolish any side because that is my strength, \"And even Rohit, once he gets settled, he scores big. Of course any opposition can have plans when they lose, they will learn out of it and will come out with a better mindset, we know about it, we will be aware of it because we know they will come out with strong plans for us,\" he said. Dhawan further said that he loves Visakhapatnam, having done well in the Deodhar Trophy to fight his way back into the national squad. \"Ive always loved coming back to Vizag. Very beautiful city, very clean city and of course the property in which we are living, it has the sea in front of us, its beautiful. \"And of course I did well in the Deodhar Trophy as you said and after that there was a drastic change in my career. As they say, Vizag is a city of destiny isnt it?

Sania was the guest of honour in the three-day event along with former Indian tennis great Vijay Amritraj and Somdev Devvarman.

The coach did not want to take me as I was too small to play tennis at that time. My mum had to force him to take me. It was a big argument and then he took me. \"After a month, he called my parents and said you have to come and watch her play because Ive never seen a six-year old play like that.

One of the most shuddering prospects for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has been that of Uday Shankar of Star and NP Singh of Sony tacitly joining hands and deciding to discreetly divide Indian crickets properties between them. In a market with only two players, that would have been a death knell for the BCCI rights, and on quite a few occasions in the past, board officials expressed apprehension of such a coalition. In such a scenario, however hypothetical or inconceivable it may be, the value of Indian cricket media rights would plummet to the point it cannot be imagined. With the takeover of 21st Century Fox by Disney, a third party, ESPN, has entered the equation, but the chances of the BCCIs fears coming true are more than ever before. ESPN-Star once again? ESPN, the flagship sports channel of Disney in the US, can now share content with Star Sports, the premier sports broadcaster in India. Concurrently, it also has a long-term pact with Sony. Though Star and Sony have not come together, there is a common thread that is linking the two which may well be cause for some worry for the Indian cricket authorities. There may be a reason for the BCCI to seek clarity before it goes public with the sale of Indian cricket rights next month. That said, how else can the deal impact Indian television in general and Indian sport in particular? Just like in the past, the Star Sport channels may be called ESPN-Star once again. As there is already Sony-ESPN, alternatively, the Star channels may be called Disney Star. That, admittedly, is only a cosmetic change. In reality, the sports content will remain the same. Because in India, Disney does not have a huge presence. Barring a few entertainment (Hungama, Bindaas, UTV) and childrens channels (Disney), there is nothing for Disney to offer to Star India, which has over 60 channels in different languages. In reality, it will be a sort of inverted takeover, which means Disney will merge with Star. In that sense, there will, however, be no impact on the IPL. It will be beamed on Star, Disney-Star or ESPN-Star. Offer too big to refuse In all likelihood, Uday Shankar, the Star India chairman and CEO, will be the point man for Disney not just in India but Asia as well. After his surprise acquisition of the IPL rights a couple of months ago, Uday was promoted as Asia head by Rupert Murdoch, the owner of 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Star India. The western media reports say Disney has offered something that, proverbially, the Murdochs could not refuse. But the reality could be something else. The talk in the Indian broadcast market is Disneys valuation of Fox went up after Star acquired the IPL rights, arguably the most lucrative cricket property. Having bought the IPL rights for Rs 16,000 crores, Murdoch has already got its value by selling Star India to Disney. Converted into Indian rupees, the $52 billion Disney-Fox deal is roughly worth Rs 3.35 lakh crore. Since the reports of the mega deal started appearing in the US media a month ago, Star officials have been silent. An otherwise articulate Uday too has been avoiding the media. He had been to the US recently but has not spoken much. Yesterday, Uday held an internal meeting with the heads of different channels in the Star office in the 40-floor Urmi Chambers in Lower Parel and urged them to be quiet about the whole deal. A top Star official was at a football forum in the city yesterday but she quietly left the meeting after presenting her paper on the Indian Super League. However, the day after the deal was announced, Murdoch wrote to the employees stating the launch of a new Fox and coming together of Disney and Fox. He has also confirmed that Star India will go to Disney but assured the staff that the merger will not affect their employment. \"While we do not yet know what these future changes will mean for our talented colleagues, we can tell you this: we are deeply committed to finding opportunities for our people as well as ensuring that anyone impacted is well taken care of,\" he wrote. Many Indian broadcast experts differ on how the deal will play out once the merger is complete, the timeframe for which is about 18 months. But everyone agrees that the deal has made heads turn, not just in India but also in the world. Predicted in 1998 There is an aside to the deal. The Simpsons, a long-running animation show, had predicted about 20 years ago that Walt Disney will take over Fox. The episode was aired on November 8, 1998. Interestingly, the American sitcom is a Fox production.','SPORTS-CRICKET','Vijay Tagore','2017-12-16 15:12:00','| Mumbai Mirror | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 15:12 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:45'),(503,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-in-australia/mitchell-marsh-completes-family-hat-trick-of-ashes-centuries/articleshow/62097372.cms','Mitchell Marsh completes family hat-trick of Ashes centuries','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62097373,width-400,resizemode-4/62097373.jpg]','PERTH: Under pressure, undervalued and ultimately underestimated, recalled allrounder Mitchell Marsh scored his maiden Test century at the WACA on Saturday to complete a rare family set of Ashes tons. Clubbing 29 fours in an unbeaten knock of 181, the 26-year-old combined with his captain Steve Smith (229 not out) in a 301-run partnership to give Australia a 146-run lead over England at stumps on day three of the third Test. The home-town hundred was another entry for the Marsh familys burgeoning scrapbook. His older brother Shaun savoured his first Ashes ton at the Adelaide Oval, an unbeaten 126 that made him Man-of-the-Match. Their father Geoff Marsh beamed with pride in the WACA crowd, having scored 138 at Nottingham as an opener in Allan Borders victorious 1989 team. \"Ill let dad know that I passed him,\" the younger Marsh told reporters, having surpassed his previous high score of 87. Though powerfully built and boasting a thunderous drive, Marsh brought little else into the match barring Sheffield Shield runs and the faith of Australias selectors. That faith had been dented over the course of 21 Tests that yielded just two half-centuries, a paltry average of 21.74 with the bat and a modest 37.48 with the ball. Under the microscope but desperate to perform in front of home fans, the WACA Test began poorly for the 6ft-4in allrounder as he dropped a straightforward catch in the slips to reprieve England opener Mark Stoneman on day one. He then went wicketless during Englands innings and conceded nearly five runs an over as Australias fourth seamer. Yet there were few signs of nerves as he combined with Smith in a swashbuckling stand that pushed England to the brink of conceding the urn with two matches to spare. After raising his ton, he pumped his fist like a piston and wrapped up Smith in a bear-hug as home fans roared. It was his privilege to see Smith in \"the zone\" at close proximity but tough, he observed, being on the wrong side of it. \"Its not very nice, you come up with all these plans and nothing works.\"','SPORTS-CRICKET','','2017-12-16 18:32:00','Reuters | Dec 16, 2017, 18:32 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:46'),(504,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/shooting/anjum-wins-fifth-gold-medal-at-national-shooting-championship/articleshow/62097979.cms','Anjum wins fifth gold medal at National Shooting Championship','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62098011,width-400,resizemode-4/62098011.jpg]','THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Punjabs Anjum Moudgil made it five out of five gold medals when she won womens 50m rifle 3 position in the 61st National Shooting Championship at National Games Shooting Range, Vattiyurkavu, on Saturday.

On an agonising day for Joe Roots team, Smith broke bowlers hearts with his second double-century against the hapless English side after all-rounder Marsh celebrated his maiden ton. The pair pushed Australia to 549 for four and a first innings lead of 146 runs, rendering Englands 403 hopelessly inadequate. They strode off to a standing ovation, with Smith unbeaten on 229 and Marsh 181 not out, pushing toward a double-century of his own. \"It felt really good yesterday, I was in the zone. I wanted to cash in today,\" Smith said before he exited the ground. \"We wanted to be out in the middle and just keep batting.\" On day two, Dawid Malan and Jonny Bairstow had English chests bursting with pride after building a 237-run stand for a record fifth-wicket stand in Tests at the WACA. The mark lasted less than a day, as Smith and Marsh smashed 57 boundaries between them to leave England praying for the mercy of rain. Showers are forecast for days four and five, but the weather may not be enough to save England, who managed only a single wicket despite no fewer than seven players rolling over their arm throughout the day. Having torched England for 107 runs in the middle session, Smith and Marsh plundered another 128 after tea, as Englands bowlers battled fatigue and the inescapable knowledge that none of their plans were working. Having punished England with 215 at Lords in 2015, Smith set himself a new personal best in a masterclass of patience, precision and timing. His unbeaten 390-ball knock has him fourth on the list of highest innings at the WACA, with the possibility of further promotion on day four. He reached the three-figure mark, his seventh against England, when he whipped paceman Stuart Broad through the leg side for four. The second hundred with a single off all-rounder Moeen Ali, and he bounded down the wicket roaring in triumph to the delight of a big day three crowd. Marsh celebrated his recall with his maiden Test century, completing a rare family trio of Ashes tons. His brother Shaun Marsh scored an unbeaten 126 in the second Test win at Adelaide Oval, and his father Geoff, beaming with pride in the heaving crowd, posted 138 as an opener at Nottingham in the 1989 series. Marsh cut paceman Stuart Broad to the fence to bring up his ton from 130 balls, and hammered the English attack with a barrage of straight drives. Moeen removed Shaun Marsh for 28 in the first hour of the day.

Name: Ishaan Tuteja Occupation: Final year college student Age: 20 Highest weight recorded: 109 kilos Weight lost: 39 kilos The turning point: When I was in 10 th standard, my friends used to bully me. I became low on confidence and couldnt concentrate on my studies. But my love for junk food never died and I kept on indulging. I somehow managed and passed 12 th standard and I got selected for a hotel management course. When I went for an interview, after clearing 4 rounds, I got rejected in the fifth round. It was quite shocking that it was due to my weight they rejected me. I felt ashamed and inferiority complex pulled me down. Read here : Winter Salads for Weight loss Getting admission in hotel management was my dream and so, rejection was quite devastating for me. I didnt allow this setback hinder my aspirations and that day I chose to be fit and healthy. My diet Initially, I was on calorie deficit diet, which included a few carbs. I started eating six times a day to improve my metabolism. After a lot of research, I successfully made my own diet plan. Before breakfast (after waking up at 9.00 am): 1 glass of lukewarm water with lemon juice. After 1 hour: Fruits (apple, pear, pineapple, papaya, orange or kiwi as these fruits have ample of vitamin C) After 2 hours (in BREAKFAST): White oats cooked in water (with cut almonds, cashews, and apple), 5 to 6 scrambled egg whites. After that, I usually go to gym for 1.5- 2 hours and once I am back, I eat 5 to 6 boiled egg whites (only 1 yolk with it). Lunch: Boiled chicken breast with boiled broccoli, green beans spinach/boiled daal After 2 hours: I eat sprouted lentils, beans, black channa with tofu added in it / 5 egg whites omlette without oil Dinner: Full plate of salad (cucumber, boiled broccoli, carrots, tomato, lettuce, cabbage, beetroot and small bowl of boiled daal (yellow lentil, green lentils or toor daal) I didnt eat chapatti or rice as they have high carbs. Also, I used to take green tea with a few lemon drops three times a day. Workout: Initially, I used to go to gym in the morning at 7 and for the first two months, I only did crossfit. There was no weight training. I just used to do treadmill and cross trainer and after those sessions, my trainer made me do High Intensive Interval Training(HIIT) Within 1.5 months, exercising and dieting helped me reduce 13 kilos. After 2 months of gym, I started doing weight training for shaping and toning my muscles with cardio and no crossfit. I started to workout for 2 hours, 6 days a week (Sundays were my rest days). I started reducing my weight week after week and got excellent results within 6.5 months, by losing 39 kilos in all. Low-calorie recipes: I dont use any oil in my diet. I dont eat fried foods. I add tofu instead of paneer, avoid spices and add a little salt and black pepper only. Fitness secrets I unveiled: The role of diet in losing fat and gaining muscles is 70 per cent and only 30 per cent is about your workout. How do I stay motivated: \"I am my only competition\" is what keeps me motivated. The thought that I have to be better every day, keeps me going. I stay motivated by watching motivational fitness videos, pages of bodybuilders and by listening to workout pump songs. How do you ensure you dont lose focus? I achieved results, I made progress and I kept on thinking about my next step towards my fitness goal. Always remember the reason you started if anytime you feel like giving up. Whats the most difficult part of being overweight? The most difficult part of being overweight is you cant do any physical activity. Your favourite clothes will not fit into your fat body, you might feel inferiority complex, you are left with no confidence and you border on depression and a perpetual laziness. What shape do you see yourself 10 years down the line? I started gaining muscles a month back and now I am on a high carb and high protein diet. Within a few years, I see myself having sculpted a body shape which is my sole dream. What are the lifestyle changes you have made? I am more energetic now. I can do any physical activity that I want to indulge in. Moreover, I can interact with anyone without any complexes in my mind and can do anything that a fit person can do to stay happy and fit. What was the lowest point for you? I was tired of eating clean and boiled food and I wanted to give up. But then I made myself understand that I have to do it to achieve my target and I am so happy I finally did it. Lessons learnt from weight loss: Being fat shouldnt even be an option as it damages your health. Eat a healthy diet to stay fit and not only to flaunt your body.

According to reports, the actor has topped the list of 50 Sexiest Asian Men 2017 for the first time. Also featuring on the list are other popular men including, Zayn Malik, Vivian Dsena, Ashish Sharma, Salman Khan, Gurmeet Choudhary, Ranveer Singh and Virat Kohli. The actor took to Twitter to express his gratitude for the seemingly unexpected win and said the title was only possible because of the love and support of his fans. But we are not at all surprised by his name topping the list. From being a chocolate boy to the brawny man he is now, Shahid has certainly come a long way. You would seldom spot the actor at a restaurant but always at the gym. In fact, most of his recent pictures on the internet have been clicked outside his gym. While its hard to ignore his natural good looks, no one can deny the fact that his sexiness has a lot to do with his lean and chiseled body. The actor is known to follow a hard gym routine and a strict diet. According to reports, the actor really works hard on his core as it enhances the bodys efficiency in performing other activities. Shahids gym regime includes planks, side planks, push-ups, bench-press, pull-ups to sumo dead-lifts, running and many other techniques. His daily fitness regime includes equipment training, cardio and body-weight exercises like burpees and a little bit of yoga. Shahid, who is a strict vegetarian reportedly banks upon protein and energy dense food to stay in shape. His daily diet is said to be a mix of tofu, paneer, soy, brown rice, fruits and green leafy veggies and amino rich food. Besides being a gym rat, the actor is a loving husband to wife Mira and a doting father to cute Misha and guess that adds to his sexiness. Its a known fact that committed men are seemingly more attractive to women and to gay men alike and with Shahid topping the chart, the asian ladies and gay men have only proved the fact. The actor, who began his innings in Bollywood doing teeny-bopper romances has transformed into a tough guy onscreen and his transformation is one of the main reasons why is one of the most followed Bollywood stars on social media. A look at his Instagram account is enough to justify why he beat Hrithik and Fawad in the game of sexiness. Lets have a look at some of his most gorgeous pictures from Instagram. Good morning. ??

My wife, who is of the same age as me, isnt very interested in having sex since she is not good at it. So, she suggested that I should try having sex with one of my female colleagues and she chose a girl from my office. Since I was a bit sexually frustrated, I befriended my colleague and we grew close. One day, when my wife wasnt home, I invited my colleague to my place and we had sex. It was a wonderful experience and she was far better than my wife. When I told my wife about the experience and also revealed that my colleague was really good at it, my wife got very excited and she wanted to talk to my colleague. My wife now wants to learn from my colleague! I was shocked and do not know if something is wrong with her. I dont know how my colleague will react if she gets to know about this. Please help me. —By Anonymous Answer by Ms. Zankhana Joshi : It can be difficult to deal with sexual incompatibility in your marriage, which can itself get exhausting. The dilemma of being sexually involved with a work colleague, which your own wife had chosen for you, can further complicate matter. It can get more difficult to discuss the encounter and then have both your partners talk to each other about it. Thus, I am glad you are seeking help for the same. From what you have shared, it seems that you and your wife have a strong emotional connection and are able to be honest and open with each other. But somehow, both are not able to experience a satisfying sexual life with each other. Sexual compatibility is a very important part of a satisfying relationshipw. I would first recommend consulting a specialist to identify the cause of the sexual difficulty faced by your wife. They would identify if there is a physiological or psychological reason behind this and treat it accordingly. Our society discourages women from being sexually expressive and free, imposing a lot of inhibitions, especially, post puberty. Soon after marriage, a girl is expected to lift the taboo and reconcile the emotion to freely experience it with her husband, which can sometimes be very difficult for some women. Women are also expected to be erotically coy, shy and inhibited. Carrying this image in mind, they are not able to give themselves permission to fully experience the pleasure and freely express it. This mental conflict can result is sexual dysfunction if there is no physical cause diagnosed. Sometimes it can also be a delayed response to the neglect, emotional abuse, and other forms of trauma that might have occured during childhood which manifests as difficulty in adult sexuality. Taking a specialists opinion would be highly recommended here. I would suggest that you should first attempt to help your wife and work on your marriage before bringing in the added complication of a third person for sexual satisfaction. What seems like a dispassionate and selfless manner in which you wife is scouting for a partner for you, is actually her way of preserving the relationship because she may be aware of the sexual inhibitions or difficulties she is facing. But my sense is that both of you are underestimating how unpredictable this situation could quickly become. You are already wondering what to say to your colleague to handle your wifes expectation of learning from her. What happens if you fall in love with your colleague or if she gets pregnant? What does it mean for your relationship with your wife? Thus, instead of talking to your colleague to learn to improve your sex life, your wife would be better off seeking professional help. You, with your patience, understanding, support and willingness to discuss her problems non-judgmentally, can play a big role in helping her too. You can make her feel secure by making her understand that you can work this out together and she doesnt run the risk of losing you. You should let her know that you would help her overcome her sexual difficulty rather than have a physical relationship with your colleague. This will make her want to work on it too. I understand how debilitating your condition can be, but if youre concerned about its impact on your marriage, start by having an honest conversation with the woman youre married to. With time, I have noticed couples overcome their sexual difficulties and find their balance by working on their differences. Taking help from a specialist can resolve these issues effectively. I believe, long-term relationships require hard work. It requires you to be supportive while the other heals. I would say be good to each other, be patient and you will find that your love will live through the challenges.

Yes, after Virushka announced the news of their wedding, which was a private ceremony at Tuscany in Italy, the Internet broke into a frenzy. Now, we can hardly wait to see where the couple is headed for their honeymoon . It seems Rome, with all its grandeur and romantic getaway, is the chosen destination! Virat and Anushka have always been tight-lipped about their relationship and kept their private life away from the prying eyes of the paparazzi and the gossip mills. For people who value their privacy, Rome is a perfect place to enjoy some special moments Like the saying goes, While in Rome, do as the Romans do\" the power couple can mix with the crowd like Romans (they wont even need to go incognito) and enjoy a great time. Great place for art lovers Rome, with its famous Vatican museums and chapels, is a dream destination for art lovers. Anushka has more than often expressed her love for the finer things in life and, we believe, she wont mind spending some time admiring the beautiful things Rome has to offer! (Photo: Instagram) Food paradise Although Virat and Anushka maintain strict diets and eat only healthy food, but they should also keep in mind that honeymoon is the time to indulge and food is not an exception. Healthy isnt the word that comes to your mind when you think of Italian or Roman cuisine. Since the couple already had a taste of Italian cuisine (remember, they just tied the knot in Italy), its time for them to discover the rich delicacies of the Roman cuisine. For the fitness freak and adventure junkie Being an ace sportsman, Virats love for fitness and adventure is known to all. Even Anushka is a fitness freak and doesnt mind indulging in a little bit of adventure sports. Although, honeymoon is not the right time for such activities, but if the couple wants to spend some time outdoors, Rome has a lot to offer. For example, exploring the Roman countryside on horseback is a romantic way to exercise your muscles and enjoy the ride. (Photo: Instagram) Best nightlife Only the lovebirds and the honeymooners know the importance of an exciting night life. When the couple wants to spend some time away from the private villa (we are just guessing!) they can always head towards Testaccio, which was earlier known as a working class neighbourhood but is now more popular for its nightlife. With its numerous bars and nightclubs where the party doesnt stop until dawn, this is the perfect place for party lovers like Virushka! Perfect place for the celebrities who love their privacy Like we said earlier, Virushka has always maintained privacy about their relationship. Rome, with its many lesser known luxury villas and beautiful countryside, is the best destination for people who wants to spend some quite moments. We are sure Virushka has made the right choice!','LIFE-STYLE-RELATIONSHIPS','','2017-12-13 16:14:00','TNN | Updated: Dec 13, 2017, 16:14 IST','2017-12-16 19:19:58'),(528,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/fashion/designers/the-story-behind-anushka-sharma-virat-kohli-wedding-outfits/articleshow/62035435.cms','The story behind Anushka-Virats exclusive wedding trousseau','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62035435,width-400,resizemode-4/62035435.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/62035436/Master.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/62035438/Master.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/62035723/Master.jpg]','The wedding of the year has taken place and internet cant stop buzzing. Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli have tied the knot and their fans are going berserk.

The best part of choosing a Boho theme for your mehendi is that it requires minimal hassle and is comfortable for the bride as well the guests. This style is a mesmerising blend of traditional and modern styles. The vibe of Ghar ki shaadi Photo: Instagram Take a break from resorts and expensive hotels and focus on making your wedding the typical Gharwali shaadi. Revisit the old times and bond with your closed ones in a family-styled villa or boutique hotels. Keep it simple and minimalist. Choose a destination that steals the show in your pictures - could be a small hill destination or a beach villa, the choice is yours. Creative Bulb Marquee This trend has been fast catching up and is here to stay! Bulb marquee transforms a venue into a dreamland and looks brilliant at any hour of the day.

The 7th Times Lit Fest at the Mehboob Studios in Mumbai saw a host of poets, authors, artistes and pubic intellectuals discuss books, literature and much more in engaging sessions throughout the day. The session titled, \"How to Spin a Great Yarn\" united the three authors with the common thread of their successful career as writers, who have voiced their own opininons on Islam, terrorism and the resultant destruction through ardent writing. Moderator Vinita Nangia got them to speak on writing and the art of storytelling, delineating on its urgency today. While Carla and Nadia extensively talk about lifes positivity and \"the light at the end of the tunnel\", Jeet Thayils voice has always been more satirical as he tends to go \"more to the darker side\". The talk began with Carla Power, a secularist who later got drawn towards Islam. When Vinita asked her what drew her to reading the Quran, Carla said her Muslim world view was sort of limited and she wanted to tag along with Sheikh Nadwi on his tour to see where their world views converged and diverged. Vinita Nangia, who took the conversation to many interesting turns with her thought-provoking and engaging questions, said that she finds it fascinating as a fellow journalist that Carla has actually delved so deep into the subject that she took out a full year to understand the Quran. She asked if it changed Carla as a person. To this Carla added, that for her, the most profound thing was not reading the Quran, but seeing how the text animated and shaped her friend Sheikh Nadwis worldview. She explained that Americans, including her, are raised to see themselves as the centre of their own universe and she was no different. And for her there was something deeply profound about spending a year trailing someone who did not necessarily see himself as the centre of his own life. Ms Nangia asked Nadia Hashimi if she found it difficult getting into the tumultous lives of Afghani women, being an Afghan girl herself who grew up in the US. To this, Nadia said \"Looking at the history of Afghanistan was a research piece. I could not interview people around me; I explored in texts. And that was exciting,\" she added. When asked if Jeet Thayils new book A Book of Chocolate Saints is an autobiography of sorts, Jeet clearly mentioned that it is a novel stating that \"lately people have forgotten how to read fiction. It may be based on a character, but that doesnt mean that what you read is a biography.\" Bringing a lively note to this conversation, Vinita countered his point saying \"You cant really blame those people as you have picked up facts from life and from real-life characters and even yourself. In some parts of your book you have even written about characteristics which are very well connected with you. Isnt it rather naughty doing that and then expecting people to imagine otherwise?\" Jeet said that he implied them as a joke, having a bit of fun with such an extensive novel. He agreed that book reviews in India can be inaccurate which will impact the success of the book but empathised with journalists as he had been one himself. \"The worst time in my life was the two decades I was a journalist\". Carla Power, agreed saying, \"Ive written headlines and I see how narrow they can be and how misleading they can be\". Ms Nangia raised an interesting question that if the best stories happen out there in reality and whether the three of them have been inspired by such real stories of real people. Both Nadia and Carla said that despite dealing with heavy themes and issues in their books, they manage to convey positivity and hope in their writing. Jeet pointed out that our reality wasnt something anyone could write, \"In 2017, with Donald Trump in America and Narendra Modi in India, how do you write fiction that could ever match up with that insanity?\" he said, drawing a huge laugh from the audience. As the talk moved to heavier topics, Carla Power spoke on how she feels boredom and inactivity lead to white supremacist terrorists, especially in small towns.She elaborated on how in \"podunkville\" towns in America, people used money from Homeland security to have people patrol the town to protect it from terrorists. While she acknowledges that the problem of terror is real, she also feels that \"America is a country that has grown too sleek and too fat and you have to invent a bogeyman\". \"What Im doing is bringing about a bit of awareness of the strength and resilience of Afghan women,\" added Nadia. The combination of Carlas worldview, Nadias incredible drive to better the world and Jeets dry humour, along with Vinitas insightful questioning, made for an enthralling session. While all the speakers seemed to agree the world is flawed, they also expressed in their own ways how to better it through representation.','LIFE-STYLE-BOOKS','','2017-12-16 12:31:00','TNN | Updated: Dec 16, 2017, 12:31 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:01'),(533,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/when-the-mantri-met-the-mystic/articleshow/61822004.cms','When the mantri met the mystic','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61822004,width-400,resizemode-4/61822004.jpg]','What happens when a neta from the cut-throat world of politics comes face to face with a man who calls himself a yogi and a mystic? A volley of questions, a battle of wits, a debate that veers between realms of spiritual quest and materialistic pursuits — thats what! When MP Kalvakuntla Kavita was in conversation with Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev in Hyderabad on Monday, she went all out and picked the mystics brains on everything from feminism and power of the feminine to success mantras and spiritual matters. The result was a laughter riot peppered with pearls of wisdom. Excerpts. Sadhguruji, since you are a mystic, I want to ask you — can you do some magic as well? (laughs) Unfortunately, human beings today are so overwhelmed with the drama of their own mind, that they are completely missing the magic of existence. See this — (pointing to a bouquet of flowers) Mud has transformed into flowers; filth has become fragrance. Isnt this magic? If magic is about me pulling out pigeons from my pocket right now, then you will have two birds and Ill just will have a pocket full of s**t! The greater magic I was hoping for was that you could do something where men in our society change their perspective towards women forever... Ah, thats why the government is funding an ISRO project for space travel to Mars. So, we can soon live on different planets (laughs)! See, ours was never a culture where women were exploited; we never wanted our women to stay hidden, covered up, behind the scenes. Unfortunately, a thousand years of invasions have changed a lot of things. When someone invades you, they dont just come after your land. They also come after your wives, daughters. Im not saying everything is perfect now. But then again, as a nation, were just 70 years old. That means we are just the second post-independence generation. Were already on our way to creating a level playing field for both sexes to a large extent. Were getting there, lets not jump the gun yet. While we are at that, let me remind you that homo sapiens are a single species; lets not act like men and women belong to different species. So basically, there is no magic, its only logic that we should focus on? (Laughs) See, this culture always understood that stable logic was needed for sustained magic... Talking of culture, weve grown up on stories from the Ramayana and Mahabharata where we see a Sita or a Draupadi being treated the way they were treated by their men. This has had a huge impact on the mindsets of Indian men... How do you suggest we bring up our sons when these are the stories they hear growing up? Let me ask the women sitting here —Suppose you were living in Uttar Pradesh 5,000 years ago, and a man came from Sri Lanka and kidnapped you. What kind of a husband would you want? someone who walked all the way to Sri Lanka looking for you? Or someone who found a solution locally? (laughs) That man walked all that way, waged a war, burnt a city down to bring his wife back. You call that bad? But he also made her go through the agnipariksha... he didnt trust her...! See, we are taking this too literally. Agnipariksha means some kind of a test. He is the ruler, everyone looks up to him as an idol. No matter what, he has to do the right thing. She is pregnant with his sons, and you know how important sons are to a king. yet, he sends his wife away to the jungle; otherwise there would be disruption in the country. you think this is negative? I think we should have presidents and prime ministers like that whod do whats right for the country, for the people no matter what is at stake personally. Cut to modern context, can you share some leadership secrets for women of today who want to go out in the world and make a mark? I think we are stretching the gender too much. whether someone is a man or a woman is not my concern. What someones got inside their pants, whats my business with it? These things are relevant only in bathrooms and bedrooms. They shouldnt be relevant anywhere else, because too much identification with gender means you are identifying with body parts. If you must identify with a body part, then why reproductive organs? at least pick the brain. We are making too much out of this. By this, both genders will suffer. True, but the world doesnt think like you. Equal opportunities are still hard to come by for us women... See, if the men sitting here want to have a baby, can they? No. So should they forever sit and complain that they dont have equal opportunity? Biologically we are designed to fulfil certain aspects of nature. Why is one thing superior, another inferior? Simply because we have made economic activity the ultimate activity. This is rubbish! Success too is graded depending on how much money someone makes! We say a successful woman should be like a man. thats a disaster! We are killing the feminine totally. Its important that we have feminine and masculine in equal measure. If not, the market place will enter your home. This is happening in the western societies already. Even before they get married, they make a contract to decide who gets what when they get divorced! How much ugliness do you want in your life? But todays women have to be out there in the world, go out and work. How do we balance it all? First of all, we dont need feminism or masculinism. We need human nature to evolve. Humanity should overflow, not masculinity or feminity. Otherwise, you are just skewing life. If women have to succeed in todays world, why are we thinking of putting a woman in a mans world and asking her to succeed? Why dont we redesign the world in a way that works for everybody? That wont happen overnight. We need to look at it sensitively and see whats needed. Success today depends not on muscle strength, but the ability of your mind. Were getting there. We just need to keep at it, rather than asking our women to become like men.','CITY-HYDERABAD','','2017-11-28 06:00:00','TNN | Nov 28, 2017, 06:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:01'),(534,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/a-glitzy-fashion-fiesta/articleshow/61692609.cms','A glitzy fashion fiesta','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61692609,width-400,resizemode-4/61692609.jpg]','It was an afternoon dedicated to beauty and fashion as ladies flocked to a city hotel to attend the launch party of a new club.

That the 15-year-old Hyderabadi is the youngest Indian to have scaled four of the Seven Summits — highest mountains of each of the seven continents — is public knowledge. But not many know that she conquered three of these four peaks after her father, whos also her coach, was diagnosed with cancer in 2015. She was all of 13 years and prepping to become the youngest Asian to climb Europes highest mountain, Mt Elbrus, when the shocking discovery of her fathers cancer was made. \"It was a few months before we were supposed to take off for the trek. The news came as a shock. My father was going to accompany me for the trek but he was forced to opt out after being diagnosed with lung cancer. However, he insisted that I go ahead and complete the trek,\" recalls Jaahnavi, who went on to complete the trek braving the snowy wilderness of Russia. \"It was my first solo trip, but I managed to survive the cold wind and fatigue and finished the climb in just 12 days,\" she adds. Jaahnavis father, Krishna Rao breaks into a smile listening to his daughter. \"She a special child, a million-dollar kid, if ever there was one,\" exclaims the 50-year-old. His battle with cancer makes for a very inspiring story in itself. \"Doctors told me then that I was in the last stage and they did not give me more than six months. But I proved them wrong. Seeing my girl scale the highest peaks of the world gives me all the strength I need to fight cancer and keep going,\" says the resident of Alwal, who accompanied Jaahnavi when she led Indias largest contingent of 28 school kids to Everest Base Camp situated 5,364 meters above sea level on the eve of Diwali. A high altitude rescuer by profession, Krishna Rao introduced Jaahnavi to mountaineering. \"I would take her along when I took students for trekking expeditions from the time she was barely three,\" shares Krishna. Jaahnavi nods in agreement and confesses that mountain peaks beckoned her from her childhood. \"My father is my mentor and guide, he trained me from the time I was just three years old, and also accompanied me on my treks all these years. My mother, Saraswati also stood by me. I owe everything to the my parents,\" says Jaahnavi. Her first high altitude trek was to the Roopkund in Uttarkhand, when she was just eight. Four years later, she became the youngest Asian to reach Kilimanjaro (5895 Mts) in October 2014 at the age of 12. \"The trek lasted 15 days and I experienced four different climate zones before reaching the summit. It was a sight to behold. The snow-capped mountain is just 322 km away from equator and its tallest peak, Kibo is a dormant volcano,\" she recalls. This expedition turned the spot light on her when a team from Guardian flew in from London to report the feat by the Indian girl. Overnight, she became a celebrity mountaineer of sorts. Next, she scaled the Mt Elbrus (5,642 meters) in July 2015. Kosciusko, the highest peak in Australia was her next summit, which she completed in one week besides accomplishing the Aussie 10 challenge (climbing 10 tallest mountains of Australia) in just four days in December 2015. But, Denali (McKinley) trek in July of last year in remote Alaska remains the hardest climb for the teenager, to date. \"Fortunately, my father accompanied me on this arduous 25-day trip. The place was so remote and without even the faintest sign of civilisation that many Americans themselves have no idea about it. The landscape was so grim and completely filled with snow,\" says Jaahnavi. \"We had to take a chartered flight equipped with sledges to land on snow to reach the Kahiltna Glacier Base camp. We had to tie ourselves to ropes all the time as avalanches are so common,\" adds Rao. With an elevation of 20,156 feet (6,144 meters), the highest mountain of North America is one of the harshest terrains in the world. \"Walking on the slippery slopes of the peak was the most dangerous thing Ive ever done. The sun never sets for six months in Arctic and for the first time I saw the incredible spectacle of the sun and moon standing side by side in the sky. The glare was so strong that, I had to wear sunglasses even inside the tent to escape from sun-blindness. I also had to battle sleeplessness,\" says the mountaineer. Her doting dad is determined to support her until his last breath. His greatest dream is to see Jaahnavi become the youngest woman to complete the Grand Slam — an adventurers challenge to reach North Pole, South Pole and all of the Seven Summits! Jaahnavi has scaled Mt. Kilimanjaro (Africa), Mt. Elbrus (Europe), Mt. Kosciuszko (Australia) and Mt. Denali (North America) so far and has three left — Everest (Asia), Aconcagua (South America) and Vinson Massif (Antarctica). Fulfilling her fathers dream has become Jaahnavis mission in life. \"My ambition is to complete the Grand Slam by 2019 and enter the record books and make my country proud. Now, my focus is on reaching the summit of Mt. Everest by April next year and later on, complete the rest of the expedition, depending on the funds available,\" says Jaahnavi, who started a crowd-funding campaign in 2017 to raise funds for her mission. In the course of supporting Jaahnavi all these years her father has sold all his properties, but he has no regrets. \"Unlike other adventurers who can afford to go on special flights and ships, we take the toughest tracks and walk all the way to summits in distant lands. I sold all my land, car and three houses to pay for Jaahnavis treks. Today, we live in a rented home in Janaki Nagar Colony in Alwal, fearing creditors and battling court cases. But, I will continue to support my child,\" says Rao. He laments that despite making the country proud, Jaahnavi hasnt received any help from either the government or corporates. \"We need at least `2.5 crore to complete the mission. Now, we need the support of government and the people, as I am short of money, having already borrowed money from everyone. Even the crowd funding failed to generate the funds, may be because I never tried to publicise her accomplishments. Now, Jaahnavi needs everyones support to complete her mission,\" say an emotional Rao, signing off.','CITY-HYDERABAD','Jayakrishnan','2017-11-13 06:00:00','| Nov 13, 2017, 06:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:02'),(536,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/this-30-yr-old-is-walking-from-kanyakumari-to-kashmir-to-empower-indias-women/articleshow/61783569.cms','This 30-yr-old is walking from Kanyakumari to Kashmir to empower India’s women','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61783569,width-400,resizemode-4/61783569.jpg]','Its been two months since Srishti Bakshi has been walking on the National Highway 44 that links Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu to Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir via major cities and towns in the country. She is on a mission to herald a change in society by sensitising the countrys womenfolk about gender issues and empower them through workshops on financial and digital literacy. A United Nations Empower Women Champ-ion for Change 2016-17, 30-year-old Srishti has pledged to walk 3,800 km through the country in 260 days, and will be reaching Hyderabad on November 28 after passing through Madurai, Bengaluru and Anantapur. \"I am a very ordinary woman. I am not an athlete or from the social development sector. But I am an army officer and a professors girl, so discipline was ingrained in me at an early age. The only reason I chose to do this is because I truly feel for the cause of Indian women and want to bring in a positive change in the society,\" says Srishti, speaking to Hyderabad Times over the phone from Anantapur. The decision to embark on whats being dubbed a modern day Dandi March however, didnt happen in a flash for this MBA from the Indian School of Business (ISB) Hyderabad. \"It all began with a conversation at a dinner table in Hong Kong in 2016. I was then working for a multi-national brand. There were people from different countries at the table. And the topics of discussion too were as varied as their nationalities — French, South Africans, Americans, et al. After a few exchanges on changing trends and life in general in the global financial hub, one of my friends suddenly shot a question at me — Tell me Srishti, why do your countrymen rape women? Though initially the question caught me dumbfounded, slowly it sank in and a sense of embarrassment took over,\" says Srishti, adding that of all the things the question did, it sowed the seeds of what would later became the Billion Steps for India campaign. \"A few days later a horrific rape happened. This time it was on National Highway 91, which the media later termed as the Bulandshahr gang rape case. The news got me fuming with rage. I was disturbed and spoke to a lot of people about it.\" \"Shockingly half of the people either didnt want to talk about the rape, terming the topic to be painful or simply brushed it off saying, yehi toh hota hain India mein,\" she says adding that these conversations acted as the trigger to do something. \"I discussed it with my husband and a few weeks passed planning a course of action,\" Srishti says. But, soon, she found her calling and decided to mix her passion with what she loves to do — hiking. \"I love hiking and have completed close to 30 trails around the world. Moreover, rather than being in an office, I wanted to work at the grassroot level and apply all my knowledge and education to make a difference. So, I decided to walk across India and empower the women in any way I can,\" she avers. For the last two months, since September 15, a typical day for the 30-year-old starts at around 4 am. Every morning after her warm-up, she, accompanied by her team, reaches the point she had finished her walk the day before, and starts walking. \"I start around 5:30 am and walk for seven hours straight till 12:30 pm. After which, my team and I take a lunch break and then we conduct our workshops in the rural areas, the audience of which are usually prepared by the district collector,\" she says. Srishti says she usually takes nine minutes to walk a kilometre, but when people join her, the time taken goes up to 16 minutes per kilometre as she matches her speed with theirs. \"Thats fine, because later I neutralise the time difference by doing power walking. It is basically is speed walking,\" she informs. Throughout her 260-day campaign, Srishti and her team will be holding close to 110 workshops in the cities and towns she visits. The workshops will cover an array of topics from health, hygiene, sanitation, leadership and gender sensitisation among others. \"The workshops are activity-based sessions where we try to educate women, children, zilla parishads and sometimes, even the police about various topics,\" she informs. She and her team have also developed an app through which people can connect with her and contribute towards the initiative. \"I wanted to change the armchair or social media activism which people today are so fond of. So, we thought lets develop an interactive app and get people involved. By downloading the app people from all over the world can contribute to the mission. The app will monitor the steps they take and with every 1000 steps, the app will unlock a notebook that will be distributed to a student in the rural areas,\" she adds. For a woman, who has been born and brought-up in North India, Srishti was initially a little apprehensive about walking and interacting with the rural population of South India. \"Initially, I thought its going to be difficult because of the language barrier. But thanks to the local volunteers, so far that hasnt been a problem at all,\" she avers. When in Hyderabad, Srishti has an action-packed schedule waiting for her. The campaigner for women empowerment will participating in multiple workshops around Hyderabad, including one at her alma mater (ISB) in the city. \"I will also take part in a night walk through the city with a motto to reclaim the night street for women,\" she informs.','CITY-HYDERABAD','','2017-11-25 06:00:00','TNN | Nov 25, 2017, 06:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:03'),(537,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/glitterati-line-up-at-this-grand-shaadi/articleshow/61783812.cms','Glitterati line up at this grand shaadi','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61783812,width-400,resizemode-4/61783812.jpg]','After a sangeet high on Bollywood oomph, Rasagnya got hitched to Anuj, in a grand wedding ceremony.

But for Azeem, khushnawees or khushkhat (calligraphy) is more grammar than art. \"It may seem like we are writing it anyway we want, but if I draw the alphabet ba in font size 12 and font size 60, the distance between the first part of the letter to the end part will be same across the two sizes,\" explains Azeem who has been a khatib for over 26 years. Chatta Bazaar, where his simple workshop is situated, was once the hub of khatibs. But today, only seven-eight are left, rues Azeem, who admits khushnawees is a dying art. \"In the 1990s, the computers came and soon, the Urdu font followed. suddenly khatibs were no more in demand,\" recollects Azeem. The first blow came from Urdu newspapers, which once mass-recruited khatibs for chronicling the citys daily life. But once the print industry moved onto the faster, cost-effective digital medium the art of khushkhat was restricted merely to ornate cards and banners. \"I wont say khushnaweesi has lost its demand completely. The advent of the digital era just made it more precious and rare — something to be cherished,\" says Azeem, wistfully. For Chatta Bazars seven-odd khatibs, who run Urdu printing shops parallely, the recent announcement that the government has declared Urdu the second official language of Telangana, serves as a small glimmer of hope to do all they can to preserve their art. \"we are the only few remaining who know this art. We have to do this, we have to keep at it, so we ensure this stands the test of time,\" says Azhar Hashmi, another khatib. But passion alone doesnt fill stomachs and that is precisely why one of them only has his fathers calligraphy collection to show in reminiscence of old times. \"I left khushnawees long time back. I used to write for Urdu dailies, but when they stopped, I lost my speed completely so I set up a printing shop,\" says 51-year-old Afzal Mohammed Khan. He pulls out his fathers blue scrapbook from under his desk, and shows it to us, with a hint of nostalgia and pride lighting up his face. \"My father, Ghouse Mohammed Khan was the best khatib in town in the 60s and 70s. He made all these,\" says Afzal, as he turns the 50-odd pages of the book to show off his fathers artistry. One of them shows the drawing of Rajeev Gandhi, with words in Urdu reading, Humara Maseeha. Another shows the masthead of the daily, Rehnumaye Deccan, another shows the masthead of a paper Munsif. \"This was a pandra-roza, or fortnightly,\" he says, pointing to the cut out of the masthead his father designed. An old picture falls off the leaf — that of Ghouse, with some dignitaries. Afzal turns over the photo to read the lines written: \"This was clicked over 35 years ago with the Education Minister Muddu Krishnama Naidu.\" The male-dominated Chatta Bazar has no sight of women, even as customers. So looking for a woman khatib is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. \"Women used to write for the fortnightly or weekly papers. But once the computers came, they too were pushed back into the homes. Now they do write, but as a hobby, not commercially,\" explains Afzal. He shows another photograph of his father with a bunch of students at the Marqaz Kushnawwezi in Nampally, where he taught young women calligraphy. Clearly, things today are a far cry from back then when Urdu got its due. Even as attempts are being made to revive the lost glory of the language, the khatibs lament that outside Old City, their art has barely any takers. \"Our market will always be the same — Old City dwellers who want wedding cards and other special correspondence written. The wedding card demand is also there only because the religious heads have mandated the use of Urdu. else everyone would have switched to English,\" says Mohammed Abdula, a khatib, adding, \"Jab tak Urdu ko tawajjon nahi milega, khatib ka haal aisa hi rahega.\" An evolving art With changing times, the art too had to evolve and adapt. While the computerised fonts of Urdu run in thousands, there are just seven fonts used for Khatib — Nastaleeq, Riqa, Diwani, Suls, Nasq, Kufi and Diwani Jali. Each of these fonts are unique not just in the way they are recreated on paper, but also unique in terms of their usage and significance. while a Suls is preferred for headings, a Kufi finds its place on the walls of a Masjid and Riqa decorates the Quran. The khatibs uses a pen with nibs of varying sizes, ranging from 1mm to a 3cm. These are entirely made with bamboo. Pens with metallic nibs are called Baru ka Kalam by some. \"Calligraphy as done before is hardly seen anymore. We use any water based ink now. earlier we used to go to a colour shop in Gulzar House were a special color called Kala Kankar was available. We would heat it in decoction to make ink,\" recollects Mohammed Abdula. Now the color shop has gone, Gulzar house has changed and so has the khatibs precious artform. Will the newfound recognition thats coming Urdus way from the Telangana government rewrite the khatibs tale and change his fortune? Only time will tell. Urdu was born here, it grew here, its our language The beauty of the language is that it is linguistically much richer. We say I love my dog and love my son with no difference between the two kinds of love in English. But in Urdu, we say Main apne kutte se pyaar karti hoon aur apne bete se Mohabbat karti hoon. that impact is what Urdu gives to expression. That difference between mohabbat and pyaar is where Urdus beauty lies. — Iqbal Patni, poet Im happy that urdu is getting its due finally The move to make Urdu the second official language of the state is a good one. Now, the government must employ translators at all offices from Mandal to Secretariat level to ensure that those who learn Urdu will get employment as well because the perception that it is only spoken by minorities is plaguing its growth. — Prof Naseemuddin Farees, MANUU Urdu is Indias awaam ki boli I cant explain how happy I am that Urdu, my mother tongue, has become the second official language of Telangana — this news made my day. Trust me, Ive been asking Mahmood Ali (deputy CM of Telangana) for years now, why we dont have names of roads in Urdu. Thats the only way people will see it and get familiar with it. Though my father lived in England for a while and I studied in an English medium school, at home we never spoke in English; it was always Urdu. When we were kids, an Urdu master would come home to teach us. It was that important. — Laxmi Devi Raj, textile revivalist Urdu is a language of poetry, music and culture. All kinds of books were translated into Urdu for the general populace to read, including the religious books. But in the 70s the state saw an influx of migrant population, that was alien to Urdu and knew little about it. My parents could read and write in Urdu, but I could only speak. So people are losing touch with the language. We are losing out on our culture and manuscripts chronicled in Urdu. the state recognition is a step to achieve the multi-lingualism which Hyderabad was once famous for. — Anuradha Reddy, historian Humare liye sona khana peena uthna baithna odhna bichana — everything is Urdu. I think Urdu is the zabaan of a whole lot of Indians. from Lucknow to Bhopal, Punjab to erstwhile Deccan provinces, the language on the street is Urdu. Strangely, its called Hindi. Urdu was largely the awaam ki boli. At a time when Farsi, persian et al were court languages, Urdu was made for the common man to speak. After independence, Hindi became the official languages. Now that the Telangana government has taken a step in the right direction, they should not simply announce it and forget about it. We should work towards making Urdu a part of everyday life. mushairas should be held again, government offices should allow public to submit requests / applications in Urdu, apart from Telugu and English, sign boards should feature Urdu prominently. Only then will this move make any real impact. — Fawad Tamkant, artist','CITY-HYDERABAD','','2017-11-19 17:29:00','Nov 19, 2017, 17:29 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:04'),(539,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hyderabad-lets-go-in-the-metro/articleshow/61822358.cms','Hyderabad, let’s go in the Metro!','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61822358,width-400,resizemode-4/61822358.jpg]','For the residents and commuters across the metro line, whove put up with years of traffic woes caused by its construction, catching a glimpse of the trail runs of the metro finally, is like an icing on the cake.

A day before the launch, we spotted a little one craning up her neck to catch a blissful sight of the metro at Miyapur. Pointing at the zooming metro line, she clapped her hands, bursting into giggles. Her mother said, \"We came out to shop after a long time and saw this. Shes been doing this every time the train passes by.\" The same excitement was shared by people in Begumpet, who had been unsure whether the metro will make it to their place, considering the safety approvals. \"I saw a bike rider who was busy on his phone throughout, until the metros horn blared and tore through the silence. none of us could take our eyes off it.

In fact, the crowd was still pouring in when the concert was underway.

In reality, it seems like the Mozart of Madras is much like any middle-aged celebrity who goes to great lengths to hide his double chin and protruding waistline from the world. Or at least thats what his retinue of PR army made apparent. \"No low angle shots, they reveal his double chin and tummy,\" hissed a member of the composers PR entourage, as he ushered us in, a good two hours after the scheduled time for the shoot. Finally, AR Rahman entered the room, and try as we may, it was hard to ignore the fact that he was holding his tummy firmly tucked in. It didnt end there though. ARR plonked himself on a couch to strike a pose, struggling all the while to hold his tummy in and chin up and taut, as the shutterbugs clicked away. Sigh! Guess, hes human after all and must be allowed his vanities. It was similar drama at the interview too, which also happened 53 minutes later than scheduled. \"Remember, you have only seven minutes for the interview,\" the PRO told us, for what seemed like 100th time. Why seven, we wondered, as we entered the room, to see the the Mozart of Madras seated, looking much like the man what weve always thought of him to be — calm, composed, shy —the perfect gentleman. He greets us with a soft \"Hello\", fully in character, sitting on a white couch, with no aura of pompousness and grandiosity, in complete contrast to his PR team. The moment we took out the phone, the PR folk jumped in again, \"No selfies please\", \"Phones are not allowed\". \"Were just recording the interview,\" we retorted, settling in for the chat. Excerpts from the seriously-brief seven-minute chat, ahead of ARRs much-touted live show. I have great memories of working with the greats of Telugu cinema He might be the man who won two Grammy and Oscars, for Telugu people he is still the man who composed the timeless Chinni Chinni Asha... \"Of course! Chinni Chinni Asha is my first Telugu song. MinMini sang the Telugu track and we decided to stick to her for the Tamil and Hindi versions as well,\" he says adding, \"I have fond memories working with all the greats of Telugu cinema — Shashtri garu, C Narayan Reddy, Ramanaidu, Raj and Koti, Mani Sharma.\" Mani Ratnam is my mentor Rahman is the midas of music. Whatever he composes is easy on ears. But for most music lovers, Mani Ratnam and AR Rahman is a jodi made in heaven. Roja, Bombay, Guru or O Kadhal Kanmani — they spell magic together. The fact that he is composing for ace directors next has got the Rahmaniacs thrilled! Decoding their magic, the music maverick said, \"When two people who have immense mutual respect, work together with a sense of competition, striving to do better than before, the outcome has to be good. In a way Mani Ratnam is my mentor. I have worked with Shankar, Imtiaz; each one has his own flavour. But Maniji is a visionary and his choice of tunes is peculiar.\" I am a listener. Thats the best way to judge your work Ask him how he managed to stay relevant to everyone from 8-year-olds to 80-year-olds, for decades, he laughed and said, \"I didnt know that. But yes, I am a listener. Thats the best way you can judge your work. Sometimes you get into art, and you feel that you have composed something good. But when you come out of it, nobody is smiling at you. They are like, what on earth is this stuff! (laughs) I always feel that if I buy a CD or a download on the Internet with my name, what is compelling about it? Is it because of respect for the musician or because its good. This is a question which I keep asking my team, will you download this, guys? If they say yes, I further ask why (laughing). Moreover the music scene is ever evolving; I keep learning new things while retaining whatever I have learnt till now. Its like keeping the base of what you are inside — the humanity — while the dressing up changes according to whats happening in the music scene.\" There are so many talented singers to choose from these days As we began to ask what qualities he looks for in young singers, the PR man butted in signalling \"2 minutes more.\" Even as we nodded, \"Personality,\" said Rahman promptly and added, \"It is very important to be themselves and to be extraordinary. Life is short, but it gives us a lot of opportunities to refine ourselves if we are not good at certain things — be it pronunciation, tuning, harkat etc. There are great singers who are slow learners, sometimes fast learners dont have personality. So the challenge is to pick up the one who has it all. Few years ago it was difficult as we had so few choices available, but now its amazing — every TV channel has got one talent hunt show and there are so many talented singers out there.\" The PR person has started sending out your times up; end it now signal even as Rahman continued speaking animatedly: \"Also singers evolve as well. There are many great singers who were not good enough before. And sometimes they are same — not improved at all (chuckling). I like people who evolve, who refine, who remain amazing and relevant over years.\" But when we came out of the room and checked the recording, the duration read: 6 minutes — 60 seconds less than the allotted time. — Inputs by Mallikarjun.Tatikonda@timesgroup.com','CITY-HYDERABAD','Papri Paul','2017-11-27 10:40:00','| TNN | Nov 27, 2017, 10:40 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:09'),(545,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/if-you-dont-know-art-at-least-heed-suggestions-of-those-who-do-city-artists-tell-ghmc/articleshow/61821888.cms','If you don’t know art, at least heed suggestions of those who do, city artists tell GHMC','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61821888,width-400,resizemode-4/61821888.jpg]','Consider this — Ivanka Trump decides to peep out of her car just before getting on to the Punjagutta flyover, enroute Falaknuma, post her presentation at GES. And her eyes land on the paintings made especially for her on the boundary wall of the Hindu burial ground. You cant fault her for wondering why there is a larger-than-life rooster perched on a stump in the backdrop of snowcapped mountains in, er, Hyderabad! Well, thats the kind of question the average commuter on the road is asking as well, looking at the random, thoughtless street art thats splashed across the city. From the congested Old City to the swanky Hitec city, the civic administration has gone all out to pretty up the entire city for the visiting delegates of the Global Entrepreneurs Summit (GES) that kicks off today. But have the chaotically spray-painted flyover pillars, walls, kerbs and medians featuring shoddy figuratives of birds and animals, and random landscapes had the desired effect, really? The citys artist community doesnt think so. This eleventh-hour beautification drive is anything but alluring, they say. Veteran artist Thota Vaikuntam is of the opinion that the civil administration should have jumped at this opportunity to highlight the culture and tradition of Telangana. \"they should have summoned the senior artists of the state and architects to discuss how to go about giving the city a facelift. if you dont know art, at least you should heed suggestions of those who do,\" he says. The 1993 National Award-winner goes on to add that though it is not easy to show the diverse culture of the state through art on pavements and walls, there is no harm in at least trying. \"The least they could have done is scan different parts of the city, its demography and highlight various cultural aspects accordingly,\" he points out. Take for instance the rendition of the Adarsh Balak who can be seen on the Falaknuma flyover with a broom and dustpan, cleaning his surroundings. While this artwork might have been apt on the walls of a school or a hospital, why is it on a railway overbridge from where thousands of delegates pass by, is hard to fathom. \"Art, more so street art, is very specific to its space and should provoke a thought in the viewers mind,\" says Anil Kumar Govindappa, a city-based artist. \"The random birds and recreations of the Charminar, Budhha Statue and Adarsh balak are merely decorative and make for a meaningless visual experience. Real street art must have a meaning and be relevant to its surroundings,\" says Anil. Avani Rao Gandra, artist, writer, photographer and curator, is of a similar view. \"It seems like this entire beautification drive has been carried out in haste, just to please some delegates. Ideally, street art should provide long-term relief to the citizens. After all, its the publics money thats been spent. I personally feel stressed out when I look at these paintings while stuck in traffic; they are such an eyesore! Instead of spray-painting the walls and flyovers thoughtlessly, they should have taken the opportunity to highlight the culture and tradition of Telangana, which they very conveniently chose to ignore. Its a lost opportunity.\" Apparently, it cost almost Rs 2 crores to beautify the Gachibowli, Panjagutta, Hitec city flyovers. GHMC however states that they have not spent public money; this was a fully CSR-funded project. The civic body also argues that there has been an attempt to showcase Telanganas art and culture. \"For instance, the Gachibowli flyover is now adorned with the 400-year-old Nirmal art showcasing popular dance forms of Telangana. The other side of the same flyover showcases Cheriyal paintings,\" says D Harichandana, Zonal Commissioner West Zone. While Nirmal paintings are made using duco and enamel paints on soft wood, Cheriyal painting is the native scroll art form of Telangana that depicts mythological narratives. How well these native artforms have been reflected on flyover walls is debatable, say artists. a few kilometers ahead, on the Hitec City flyover the theme changes totally with figuratives of the national bird, peacock and state bird, palapita, in 3D avatar, accompanied by some colorful spray paint art. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to anything, lament the artists. \"Our project was inspired by the Philadelphia art project,\" points out Harichandana. What she is referring to is the much-acclaimed City of Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, an anti-graffiti programme where professional artists and prosecuted graffiti vandals collaborated to create new murals in the city. Humantha Rao, proprietor of Gallery Space, concurs saying, \"If thats what the idea was, the civic body should have commissioned the work to accomplished artists. I am sure the end-product would have been different then; at least the theme would have been better. I dont understand the aesthetics behind the messy use of spray paints on flyover pillars and meaningless paintings of sceneries and animal kingdom on the walls. The administration should have taken inspiration from other cities like Kolkata and Gujarat, where they have used mosaic murals to beautify key milestones.\" Well, critics be damned. The administration plans to continue this plastic surgery in a bid to give the city a facelift, unhindered. Meanwhile, those of us who think its an eyesore, will have to wait for time to take its toll on the kitschy paintings.

We can say this with conviction because their official YouTube channel has over 2 million subscribers and a staggering 563,180,725 views! While theyve contributed to a slew of Hindi film OSTs and come out with some hit covers and mash-ups, their composition Main Hoon — the Indian anthem for the Amazing Spider Man 2 — made them a force to reckon with in the indie music scene. No brownie points for guessing that were talking about Sanam, the hottest new boy band around, and winners of the Best Music Content award in the national category at the recently-concluded Social Media Summit and Awards in Vijaywada. In a tete-a-tete with Hyderabad Times, three members of the band — Samar Puri, Keshav Dhanraj, Venky S — spoke about why they changed the bands name from SQS Supastars to Sanam, how composing music is an egalitarian concept for them and why they dont really like to be called the One Direction of India. Excerpts. Congratulations on winning the award. Everything seems to be going pretty well for you guys as a band — millions of followers, Bwood projects, high-flying collaborations et al... Samar Puri: Honestly, awards are very subjective. As a band, we dont think that awards define an artiste or his work; art is art. We respect and look up to all artistes, no matter how big or small. There is always something unique and new to learn from everyone. Having said that, it surely feels good to be appreciated for our work. Seeing our songs bringing broken families together and connecting new people around the globe is what inspires us to continue doing what we do. Keshav Dhanraj: It feels good to know that so many people enjoy our music. We feel blessed and fortunate to have found each other. Our focus is not, and has never been, on the number of followers. We only focus on our work and of course, on doing things that make us happy. Your band name was changed from SQS Superstars to Sanam. Was it because you thought Indian indi-pop fans will be able to relate more to such a lovey-dovey name? Keshav Dhanraj: SQS Project was initially Samar, Quesh (an ex-member), Keshav and Sanam. It was an abbreviation of only three of our band mates names initials and didnt represent the band properly. The funny story behind our initial name goes back to when we met our manager and fifth member, Ben Thomas. Despite the kind of experience and reputation he has in the industry after working for years with some of Indias top artistes, when he put a word out for the band many people misunderstood us to be some construction company or business venture. SQS Project has a very corporate feel to it, dont you think? Venky S: The band name Sanam was chosen after filtering more than 300 other names. We were discussing names and suddenly realised that the word Sanam represents us completely — both as individuals and a collectively. The word is used in many languages and cultures. In Hindi it means beloved, which represents the kind of music we make and also our goals as individuals and as a band. And to top it, our vocalist and frontman is Sanam Puri. So, we collectively decided to call the band that. Your second album was called Samar Sanam. So, do Sanam and Samar Puri call all the shots for Sanam? Venky S: Every member of our band is equally important and has equal responsibilities. We are a team in the real sense of the word. After our first album SQS Supastars was released, we were left with a number of unreleased songs both Samar and Sanam had put together. Our band technically came into being much later, when we met Ben. The album Samar Sanam was a compilation of those songs by Samar and Sanam. You are called the One Direction of India... That must be flattering... Samar Puri: Well, One Direction was a great boy band and Im sure they will get back together over time. We enjoy all kinds of music and respect all artistes. Having said that, there is a difference between us and them — apart from the fact that they have disbanded. One big difference between One Direction and us is that they were five (later four) singers whereas we are a band of musicians. We collectively compose, record and program music. Each of us are multi-instrumentalists. You are such a talented bunch of musicians; how does it work when you get together to compose music? They say too many cooks spoil the broth; has such a thing ever happened to you? Samar Puri: We all take up different responsibilities at different times. But we always sit together and work everything out. We respect each others ideas and always make sure we release something only if all four of us are happy with the product. We do have different musical influences and do go through many changes as we compose, program and produce. Thats the final product you get to hear; a blend of different musical influences in every song. Most of your bandmates have composed and sung for quite a few Bollywood ventures. Will we ever see you coming to the Telugu film industry? Samar Puri: I have actually sung a Telugu song called E kadha by Mickey J Meyer — it was fun. The music being released these days in the South, especially the Telugu film songs, are really fresh and interesting. If something exciting comes our way, we will be happy to collaborate. Currently though, we are swamped with many projects.

The last few years have had several reported cases across the country, in which members of the staff of a school sexually assaulted a student. In most such cases, the accused was employed at the school only a short while before the incident, often through third-party vendors without proper police verification. Even as security lapses regarding the latest incident continue to come it is prudent to ask, how safe are our schools? After the rape of a six-year-old in a school in Bengaluru in 2014, the Bengaluru Police made background verification of school staff members mandatory. But Praveen Sood, ADGP, says that the issue is not about verification or criminal antecedents. \"Child sex abuse is often done by first-time offenders and no police verification can identify a pervert. At best, schools should avoid having men on their staff at least at the primary level, which has very young children who are dependent on adults.\" SECURITY LAPSES IN SCHOOLS ARE COMMON; the ONUS IS ON ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE SAFETY On condition of anonymity, a member of an NGO that deals with the prevention of child abuse, says, \"There are guidelines that schools are expected to follow to prevent abuse cases, but who is following up on whether rules are being implemented? Punitive action has been mandated if schools fail to adhere to guidelines. The problem is that no one really checks if everything is in place. When have we last heard of random inspections at schools to check on safety requirements? Who should be doing it? Every time there is an issue, school authorities are hauled up, but why not the Boards that have allowed these schools to function.\" Also speaking to us on condition of anonymity, a Bengaluru police official adds, \"Ensuring that guidelines are implemented and followed is the prerogative of the school, education body and the police force. All the stakeholders should work together in ensuring that the school environment is safe for children, but ultimately, the onus lies with the school management to adhere to rules.\" SENSITIZING CHILDREN IS CRUCIAL \"Given the current situation, the school management, as well as teachers, have a huge role to play to ensure child safety at the premises and even otherwise. While regularly making rounds of every nook and cranny of the campus, particularly those that are not under CCTV surveillance, keeping a tab on any suspicious behaviour and taking every complaint seriously are among the main parameters that need to be maintained without fail, conducting orientation sessions for the non-teaching staff has become the need of the hour. Most importantly, sensitizing children about inappropriate behaviour by anyone, good and bad touch should be made a priority by every school,\" says Kavita Ghosh, a teacher at Delhi Public School (Bangalore South).','CITY-BENGALURU','Prathibha Joy and Reema Gowalla','2017-09-12 00:00:00','| TNN | Sep 12, 2017, 00:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:12'),(548,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/a-short-film-that-shines-the-spotlight-on-child-anxiety/articleshow/61672748.cms','A short film that shines the spotlight on child anxiety','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61672748,width-400,resizemode-4/61672748.jpg]','When theatre artistes Devanand Mahakud and Rakhee Bose set out to make short films, their only intention was to tell good stories that could contribute positively to society. They have made two films already, Lapata — about the denial and rejection of rape survivors by their families — and Koshish — a short that explores marital relationships and how easily spouses give up on each other. The duo is now ready with their third, Piu Ka Pen, an 18-minute short on child anxiety, which will be premiered at Lahe Lahe on November 18. \"We always wanted to do a film on children, but if you notice, most of the existing work revolves around child abuse, trafficking or labour — subjects that are being dealt with because there has been dialogue surrounding it. Child anxiety, on the other hand, is still often hushed up, with most parents in denial that their wards could be suffering from some form of depression, which may or may not result in them hurting themselves,\" says Rakhee, who conceptualized the film. In fact, when Rakhee and Devanand began putting the script together, they wondered what would drive a child to hurt his/her self and began researching on this and discussing with subject experts. During their conversations with parents, Rakhee says that they realized that parents believe that by providing their children with everything they could possibly want, in terms of material items, they were sorted and didnt need anything extra. \"There is no denying that there is a big chasm between parents and their children, with the former often in the dark about what the latter is up to. In this context, we thought it was imperative that we address this and get parents to understand the subtle symptoms that could tell them if their child is depressed or not. Initially, like most filmmakers, we were also looking at making a product that could be sent to film festivals. But around the time that we were editing Piu Ka Pen, we heard about the Blue Whale Challenge and thought that we needed to do something more. So we decided to create a campaign around the need of seeking help,\" explains Rakhee. As the first step, the film team will conduct a discussion after the screening with child mental health experts, Dr MV Ashok and Dr Yesheswini Kamaraju. \"We are looking at connecting with city schools to screen the film and take the campaign further,\" says Rakhee.','CITY-BENGALURU','Prathibha Joy','2017-11-17 00:00:00','| TNN | Nov 17, 2017, 00:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:13'),(549,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/take-part-in-times-sudoku-championship-on-sept-28/articleshow/60841815.cms','Take part in Times Sudoku Championship on Sept 28','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-60841847,width-400,resizemode-4/60841847.jpg]','Do your mornings begin with a steaming cuppa, seated on your favourite chair, with a newspaper and pen in hand, cracking Su-doku numbers?

Wishful thinking, one might say, given that the citys traffic woes have pretty much got everyones goat. And if the experts are to be believed, it is only going to get worse. Conservative estimates put the vehicle population on Bengalurus roads at over 70 lakh, (which does not consider the non-Karnataka registered ones) — a nearly 100% rise in a decade — which is expected to cross a crore in the next five years. Solutions such as increased use of public transport and carpooling are among the primary suggestions that crop up, but a quick look at our roads will point to the fact that no one follows this. Most cars on our roads, if not a cab, have single occupants. So, we asked two men who deal with traffic issues on a daily basis for their thoughts on decongesting Bengaluru. One of the major reasons for the dense volumes of vehicles on our roads is the psychology of the working class. They dont drive a car as a necessity, but see it as an asset or luxury. Hence, carpooling is not going to work, as they think that sharing a vehicle is only for the poor. Second, there is a need to ban old vehicles. Registration of new vehicles is not really the issue, as they are more energy-efficient and relatively more safe. We recommend that vehicles over 15 years should be banned from the streets owing to the pollution caused and their lower road-worthiness. At the moment, re-registration of old vehicles based on a fitness test is allowed for commercial vehicles. That should be stopped. Once these old vehicles are off the road, it will reduce the burden to a certain extent. Third, we require more Metro lines to connect the entire city. At present we are at less than 100 km connectivity and will need at least 500 km coverage to effectively decongest the roads. It is our legacy that we plan things late, and hence, orders for extra bogies for the existing lines have gone only now, as officials earlier thought it would be manageable with the three carriages that each train had. Metro has to be taken up on a war footing, else by the time plans are executed, Bengaluru traffic will grind to a standstill. — R Hithendra Additional Commissioner of Police, Traffic Urging people to car pool or use public transport will have very minimal impact on the vehicle density on our roads. Major impact will be in controlled parking on our streets. 60% of Bengaluru roads are narrow, which are not being widened or cannot be. If parking is allowed on either side of such stretches, it reduces the capacity by 1/3 to 2/3. In such a scenario, if the powers that be are serious about decongesting the city, they should think about removing all on-street parking, creating parking lots elsewhere as multi-level car parking (MLCP) structures or off-street parking on open fields. In the long run, they will also have to explore the option of having multi-level basement parking structures below the various parks in the city. Instead of calculating the volumes on our roads and how much widening of roads should happen to accommodate the traffic, the government is widening footpaths, irrespective of the number of pedestrians who take that route. Right now, what we are doing — decreasing the width of existing roads and allowing parking on these stretches — is wrong. Bengaluru has about 14,000 km stretch of road, of which 60% is narrow. Close to 30% roads do not have footpaths at all, due to which pedestrians walk on the stretches meant for vehicles. New infrastructure, in the form of flyovers and grade separators, will only push more traffic in that direction. Instead, authorities should improve public transport, especially Metro and mono-rail, to allow people to get in and out anywhere they want. — MN Sreehari, Traffic exper t','CITY-BENGALURU','Prathibha Joy','2017-09-14 00:00:00','| TNN | Sep 14, 2017, 00:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:14'),(551,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/mercury-plunges-turns-sunday-chilly/articleshow/61622360.cms','Mercury plunges, turns Sunday chilly in Bengaluru','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61622435,width-400,resizemode-4/61622435.jpg]','BENGALURU: There has been a nip in the air over the past few days, prompting Bengalureans to plunge into their wardrobe in search of their woollens.

Mooting the idea, Home Minister Ramalinga Reddy had recently said that the government would keenly observe how well the latest implementation of the policy fares in Delhi, before trying it out in Bengaluru to reduce traffic and pollution. Enforcement is not easy Implementing the policy here, though, is not going to be easy, say experts, adding that it will not have the desired effect either. Traffic expert MN Sreehari, for instance, is dead against the idea. \"Who is going to enforce the policy? How many traffic policemen can be spared to implement this rule when they have to keep track of over 48,000 junctions and the thousands of kilometres of road? How many more cameras will have to be deployed to capture moments of people flouting the rule? And what prevents motorists from switching between a four-wheeler and a two-wheeler according to the allowed number plate for the day or, for that matter, fixing fake number plates that are easily available at JC Road or Kalasipalayam? If pollution control is at the heart of this policy, they have got it all wrong and should instead look at preventing fuel adulteration, which happens in the outskirts of the city. Most lawmakers and enforcers are aware of this and have not been doing anything about this. Once they stop fuel adulteration, the exhaust will automatically be far less polluting and harmful to the environment,\" he says. Will implement govt wish: Cops Additional Commissioner of Police, R Hithendra, however, refused to comment on the issue, adding that his department would do whatever is necessary to implement the policy, in the event of the government ordering the same. \"We are government servants and will implement the rule if the government so wishes,\" he says. In an earlier conversation with us, Hithendra had said that effective carpooling, ban on old commercial vehicles, and better coverage of public transport systems, like the Metro, for instance, were the only feasible means to curb the citys traffic menace, which is poised to hit the once-crore mark in the next five years. Exemptions will make mockery of policy Speaking to us on condition of anonymity, a senior police official said that the odd-even policy cannot take off without a robust public transport system in place. \"Even with a fairly good public transport system, the odd-even policy has not worked in Delhi, then how can it in Bengaluru? Lets say the government goes ahead and implements the rule and gets some 30 lakh vehicles off the road on a particular day. Even if five lakh find a way out of this, how are you going to cater to the transport needs of the other 25 lakh? Is the government going to tell people to head out to work only every alternate day?\" he asks. The other issue, the official adds, is that once the policy is implemented, there will be multiple exemptions, starting with, for instance, government vehicles. \"Then, like it happened in Delhi, there will be exemptions for women, cabs, senior citizens and so on and so forth. Eventually, it will become a mockery of the system. If the policy is implemented or not, what could be done is for big companies with huge staff strength to enforce carpooling,\" he says.','CITY-BENGALURU','Prathibha Joy','2017-11-19 00:00:00','| TNN | Nov 19, 2017, 00:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:17'),(555,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/swarathma-leads-from-the-front-at-a-musical-cleanathon/articleshow/60461315.cms','Swarathma leads from the front at a musical cleanathon','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.comhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-58127550/toilogo.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.comhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-58127550/toilogo.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.comhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-58127550/toilogo.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.comhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-58127550/toilogo.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-60461315,width-400,resizemode-4/60461315.jpg]','Their songs hold a mirror to the society, and Swarathma often goes beyond the confines of a recording studio and uses its music as a mode of activism and motivation.

Over the years, the celebrations have grown by ten folds, and with maximum participation from people and parking issues cropping up every year, this time many organizations have shifted base to a different venue. BT explores more… MORE CROWD, LESS SPACE One of the biggest associations in Bengaluru — the Bengali Association — this year has decided to shift the Durga Puja celebrations to Manpho Convention Centre. Speaking about the venue change, Dileep Maitra, vice president of the association says, “For the past 12 years, The Bengali Association was organizing the celebrations at the RBANMS College Grounds, close to the association premises. However, this year, since the college administration has created a football and cricket academy, the space has been reduced to one-third of what was available.” Similarly, the Assam Society of Bangalore too, decided to change venue this year. “For the first three years, we organized the celebrations in Koramangala. But since we witnessed a large crowd last year, we moved out of that area and decided to have the celebrations in HSR Layout, at a bigger venue,” says Hirak Jyoti Kakati, General Secretary of the society, adding that with the change, it has also solved parking problems. “Earlier, we used to have a lot of issues with regards to parking. However, ever since we decided to shift the celebrations to HSR Layout, the parking woes have been solved too,” he says. In addition to this, this year, the organizers are also focusing on bigger food courts. “While shifting the venue may cause a little hassle, it will allow us to have bigger food courts and more space, thereby making the celebrations a lot more fun,” adds Dileep. Shifting venues will see more participation from locals Priya Mukherjee, member of the Bannerghatta Durga Foundation says that shifting venues will help in more participation from locals. “Durga Puja celebrations are not just restricted to Bengalis. This year, we are moving to a different venue as we want to do a village-themed puja (Gram Bangla). We cannot do a village-themed puja inside four walls. So, we decided that by taking out the celebrations to a bigger venue, not only will we be able to increase the scale of the pujo, but we will see more participation from locals as well,” says Priya. But what about the footfall, we ask the organizers? “Obviously, if we move the celebrations to a different venue every year, it will affect the participation and we will lose our crowd,” says Hirak. But moving to a different place can go both ways, feels Dileep. “It is a litmus test for us. It is the first time in 12 years that we have changed the venue, but in order to accommodate more people, have better parking facility and more food stalls, this was our best option,” he says. Priya also feels that changing venue will work in their favour. “Footfall will automatically be there for Maa Durga. It is about reaching out to people. People won’t mind travelling at lengths to be in her (Goddess Durga) presence,” she sums up.','CITY-BENGALURU','Sandra Marina Fernandes','2017-09-27 00:11:00','| TNN | Sep 27, 2017, 00:11 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:19'),(558,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-goes-back-to-the-tradition-of-calling-docs-home/articleshow/61688441.cms','Bengaluru goes back to the tradition of calling docs home','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61688441,width-400,resizemode-4/61688441.jpg]','With the advent of smartphones and the applications (commonly known as apps) they support, it has become convenient to get all our domestic jobs done without having to move around much. Right from food, refreshments and groceries to medicines, cabs and electricians, receiving commodities and services in the comfort of our homes has become as easy as snapping our fingers. While most of our needs are covered, one that is critical, but not that easily accessible is the healthcare sector. Bridging that gap slowly are Bengaluru-based apps that are using technology for people to go back to the age-old tradition of getting doctors to visit patients at their homes. Essentially, these apps function like cab-hailing apps, only that theyre for doctors. ZevA, founded by school friends Srinivas Sastri and Shashi Bhushan, is one such. With services from professionals such as doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians available at the click of a button, starting the end of this month, the makers are looking to disrupt the way healthcare has been functioning. Srinivas says, \"Healthcare can be divided into two sectors — primary care, which is the most prevalent form of treatment, and specialized care. Our app focuses on the former, giving patients the option to choose to be treated for common ailments and injuries by doctors in the neighbourhood, instead of relying on self-diagnosis and medication. Patients can choose from doctors based on their language preferences, distance and consultation charging\" The app also has an SOS button thats linked to the Bengaluru City Police app, Suraksha. Srinivas elaborates, \"This is for the safety of both the physicians and the patients. Since physicians will be visiting private buildings, neither do we want the patients to feel unsafe, nor do we want to put the doctors in tricky situations. Since its linked with Suraksha, cops can be at the venue within five minutes of pressing the SOS button.\" Another Bengaluru-based home healthcare app that functions similarly is Nightingales, founded by Lalit Pai and Himanshu Shah, has been live for the past six months. Speaking about the app, Chief Technical Officer Gowtham Jayaram says, \"More often than not, its the patients next of kin that requests for doctors services. So, we wanted to make an app that provides a continuum of patient information to the end users, be it the patient themselves or the next of kin, so, wherever they are, they know whats happening. Thats important in todays world, when almost all family members are away at work or college.\" Whats common among these apps is that while people can request for visitations from qualified nurses, dentists, physiotherapists and dieticians, the doctors are general practitioners and not specialists. Also, the apps USP is that they are hyperlocal, meaning doctors in the vicinity will be notified when someone is unwell and requests for them, making house visits much more efficient and faster. And all of the users electronic health records and history are quantified and saved, making it less complicated when new doctors turn up for consultation and treatment. One area that both these apps differ is that while Nightingales employs all physicians on their payroll, in ZevA, the app is just another platform for them to provide their services — and both have their advantages. Srinivas says, \"Every year, thousands of doctors and nurses graduate, and not all of them get jobs in hospitals or have the money to set up their own clinics. An app like ours, which has 2,500 doctors and 400 nurses on board, will give them an avenue to provide their services, and patients get quicker treatments.\" Gowtham says, \"By employing all the physicians on our payroll, we have better control over the quality of services they provide.\" Healthcare has never been more convenient.','CITY-BENGALURU','Mohammed Waseem','2017-11-18 00:00:00','| Nov 18, 2017, 00:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:21'),(559,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/parliamentary-elections-nepals-left-alliance-wins-81-seats-heading-towards-majority/articleshow/62010889.cms','Parliamentary elections: Nepals Left alliance wins 81 seats, heading towards majority','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62010923,width-400,resizemode-4/62010923.jpg]','KATHMANDU: Nepals Left alliance was on Sunday heading towards a comfortable majority in the parliamentary elections, winning 81 seats so far in the historic polls that many hope will bring the political stability to the country. The CPN-UML led by former prime minister K P Oli and the CPN-Maoist led by former premier Prachanda have forged an electoral alliance for both the provincial and parliamentary elections. As the alliance was headed for a clear majority in the 275-member Parliament, Oli is being projected to succeed Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. Oli won from the Jhapa-5 constituency by more than 28,000 votes as he defeated Nepali Congress candidate Khagendra Adhikari. He polled 57,139 votes, the highest number of votes so far secured by any candidate in the election. According to results released by the Election Commission, the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist (CPN- UML) has won 59 seats while its alliance partner CPN Maoist- Centre bagged 22 seats out of the total 165 seats under the first-past-the-post election system. The ruling Nepali Congress (NC), which was the largest party in the last election, managed to win only 12 seats, according to tallies. Two Madhesi parties, Federal Socialist Party Nepal and Rastriya Janata Party, have so far secured three Parliamentary seats each. The Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the Naya Shakti Party led by former prime minister Baburam Bhattarai and an independent candidate have secured one seat each. The counting of votes in the proportionate voting system was under progress. The NC is expected to perform better in the proportionate voting, which was evident from the initial counting trends. Although the two major communist parties are set to form the government, it is unlikely that they would secure two third majority in the election. A Maoist leader, on the condition of anonymity, said that though the Left alliance is tilted towards the northern neighbour (China), the new government needs to strike a balance between the countrys two giant neighbours (India and China) while pursuing its foreign policy. The two parties are also considering to merge to form the largest communist party in Nepal. If they merge, the post of party president and the countrys president will be shared between Maoist chief Prachanda and top UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, according to party insiders. UML leader Nepal has won the parliamentary election from Kathmandu-2 while Prachanda is set to win from Chitawan-3 constituency. There was a tacit understanding among three key leaders of the alliance to share the three top posts, reliable sources have claimed. The house of representatives consists of 275 members, of which 165 would be elected directly under the first-past-the- post system while the remaining 110 will come through the proportional representation system. Voting in two-phased parliamentary and provincial assembly elections were held on November 26 and December 7. In the first phase, polling was held in 32 districts, mostly situated in the hilly and mountainous region, in which 65 per cent of voters had exercised their franchise. In the second phase, 67 per cent voter turnout was registered. A total of 1,663 candidates contested polls for parliamentary seats.','WORLD-SOUTH-ASIA','','2017-12-10 20:11:00','PTI | Dec 10, 2017, 20:11 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:22'),(560,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/india-most-reliable-regional-partner-of-afghanistan-pentagon/articleshow/62088510.cms','India most reliable regional partner of Afghanistan: Pentagon','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62088500,width-400,resizemode-4/62088500.jpg]','WASHINGTON: India is Afghanistans \"most reliable regional partner\", the Pentagon told the US Congress on Friday as it welcomed additional economic, medical, and civic support from New Delhi to the war-torn country. \"India is Afghanistans most reliable regional partner and the largest contributor of development assistance in the region,\" said the Pentagon in its report to the Congress titled Enhancing Security and Stability in Afghanistan. This assistance includes civil development projects such as the Afghanistan-India Friendship Dam and the Afghan parliament building, the report said. India provides significant training opportunities for Afghan officers and enlisted personnel and has frequently offered to increase its burden sharing for Afghanistan, it said, adding that approximately 130 Afghans travel to India each year to attend various military and commissioning programmes. India has also donated limited security assistance, most notably four Mi-35 aircraft, the Pentagon said. \"The new South Asia policy highlighted our relationship with India and called on India to provide more assistance to the international efforts in Afghanistan. The United States welcomes additional Indian economic, medical, and civic support to Afghanistan,\" the Pentagon said in its report. This is the first report of the Pentagon to Congress after US President Donald Trump announced his new Afghan and South Asia policy in August. \"Our purpose in Afghanistan remains the same: to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a safe haven from which terrorist groups can plan and execute attacks on the United States, or our allies and citizens abroad. To accomplish this, we continue to support our Afghan partners and train, advise, and assist its military and government institutions,\" it said. Under the new strategy, the US will continue to support the Afghan government and security forces in the fight against the Taliban, al-Qaeda, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria - Khorasan (ISIS-K), and other insurgents and terrorists, to strengthen the Afghan government and prevent reestablishment of terrorist safe havens in Afghanistan. \"A major change from our previous strategy is the shift from a time-based approach to a conditions-based one. This shift underscores the US commitment to the continued development of the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF), provided that our Afghan partners satisfy their obligations,\" the Pentagon said. The new strategy does not mean a return to US-led combat operations, instead, the key to success lies in improving ANDSF capabilities and allow them to lead in the fight against the Taliban, it clarified. \"We will continue to work by, with, and through the ANDSF to help them defeat their enemies and to ultimately arrive at a political settlement in Afghanistan,\" said the Pentagon.','WORLD-SOUTH-ASIA','','2017-12-15 22:16:00','PTI | Dec 15, 2017, 22:16 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:25'),(561,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/new-york-bomber-read-extremists-books-urged-wife-to-do-so/articleshow/62055790.cms','New York bomber read extremists books, urged wife to do so','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62055695,width-400,resizemode-4/62055695.jpg]','DHAKA: The Bangladeshi-origin New York City bomber had read books by an Islamist cleric convicted for inciting the murder of an atheist blogger in the country and also \"encouraged\" his wife to do so to learn about religion, police said on Wednesday. Akayed Ullah, 27, suspected bomber, had a crude pipe bomb strapped to his body. The device exploded prematurely on Monday between two subway platforms near Port Authority, injuring him and three others. Bangladesh security officials said that they have found no evidence of a local militant link of Ullah despite his fascination to Islamist literatures. \"We have not found any link between Akayed Ullah and local militant groups or any political party. We have not found any clue of his affiliation with any militant outfit in Bangladesh,\" police counter-terrorism unit chief Monirul Islam told reporters. His wife told investigators that Ullah used to \"encourage\" her to read books by a convicted Islamist outfit chief Jashim Uddin Rahmani as he appeared to have been radicalised over the internet after moving to the United States, he said. \"She said he used to tell her to read the books of Jashim Uddin Rahmani to learn about religion or Islam. We are reviewing the information provided by his wife and other relatives,\" Islam said. Rahmani, the leader of the outlawed Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), was jailed by a Bangladesh court in 2015 for five years for inciting the murder of atheist blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider in Dhaka. His books were easily accessible on the internet until some years ago. The ABT is a homegrown extremist group which is behind the killings of several bloggers, writers and gay rights activists in Bangladesh. Reports suggest that US officials have found evidence that Ullah had watched Islamic State propaganda on the internet. Islam said that though no official request has been made, Bangladesh passed on the information on Ullah to US security agencies on its own as \"we have given highest priority on this issue because of our zero-tolerance policy against terrorism\". An official familiar with the investigation said Ulllahs wife was \"surprised to find out what her husband did\" after he exploded a pipe bomb strapped to his body which he did some 30 minutes after his routine telephonic talks with her. Bangladesh polices counter-terrorism unit questioned her and other relatives for several hours. Police said that Ullah, who became a US resident in 2011, visited Bangladesh three months ago and spent most of the time at home with their six-month-old son. Ullah is suspected of trying to blow himself up at New Yorks main bus terminal presumably inspired by Islamic State ideals while investigators are trying to unearth what led to the bombing, and who - if anyone - might have assisted him. His improvised explosive device, however, did not work as intended, causing minor injuries to bystanders. Authorities took the suspect into custody alive and later brought federal charges against Ullah, who has so far appeared to be the lone wolf in plotting and staging the attack.','WORLD-SOUTH-ASIA','','2017-12-13 19:24:00','PTI | Dec 13, 2017, 19:24 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:26'),(562,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/left-will-lead-nepal-in-line-with-constitution-says-prachanda/articleshow/62070967.cms','Left will lead Nepal in line with Constitution, says Prachanda','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62071166,width-400,resizemode-4/62071166.jpg]','KATHMANDU: Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Chairman Prachanda lashed out at the Nepali Congress leaders on Thursday for dubbing the Left alliance as \"authoritarian\" and said that his coalition will lead the nation in line with the Constitution.

During the recently concluded elections, there were charges levelled by the Nepali Congress leaders that the Maoists would impose autocratic system through Constitutional amendment if they get two-third majority in the elections. \"It was wrongly publicised that the country will head towards uncertainty after the victory of Left alliance,\" Prachanda told journalists in Chitawan district.

The military has denied its soldiers raped any Rohingya women. Here are the accounts as told by 21 women and girls. They agreed to be identified in this story by their first initial only, out of fear the military will kill them or their families. She is only 13 She is only 13, but R had already learned to fear the military men. Last year, she says, soldiers stabbed her father to death. One day in late August, 10 soldiers barged into Rs house. They snatched her two little brothers, tied them to a tree and beat them. R tried to run out the front door, but the men caught her. They tethered her arms to two trees. They ripped off her earrings and bracelets, and stripped off her clothes. R screamed at them to stop. They spit at her. Then the first man began to rape her. The pain was excruciating. All ten men forced themselves on her before she passed out. Rs older brothers carried her toward the border. Once in Bangladesh, a doctor gave her emergency contraceptives. R desperately misses her little brothers, and her sleep is plagued by nightmares. She struggles to eat. Before the rape, she says softly, she was pretty. Raped twice F and her husband were asleep at home in June when seven soldiers charged into their bedroom. The men bound her husband with rope and gagged him with a scarf they ripped from Fs head. They yanked off Fs jewelry and stripped off her clothes. They threw her to the floor, where the first soldier began to rape her. Her husband wriggled the gag from his mouth and screamed. One soldier shot him, and another slit his throat. After the assault, the men dumped Fs naked body outside her home and set it on fire. The neighbors rescued her. Two months later, she realized she was pregnant. In September, her nightmare began again. F was asleep at a neighbors house when five soldiers broke down the door. The soldiers slashed the throat of the 5-year-old boy who lived there and killed his father. They stripped off the womens clothes. Two men raped F, and three men raped her friend. After the men left, the women lay on the floor for days before fleeing for Bangladesh. Despite everything, F is determined to love the child. Her husband blamed her K and her family were settling down to breakfast one morning in late August when they heard the screams of other villagers outside. Her husband and three oldest children bolted out the door. But K was nearly 9 months pregnant and had two toddlers to watch. She couldnt run anywhere. The men barged in, threw her on the bed, yanked off her jewelry and stole the money she had hidden in her blouse. They ripped off her clothes and tied down her hands and legs with rope. When she resisted, they choked her. And then they began to rape her. She was too terrified to move. One man held a knife to her eyeball, one a gun to her chest. Another forced himself inside her. Then they switched places. All three men raped her. She began to bleed and was certain her baby was dying. She blacked out. When she awoke, the men had gone. Her husband blamed her for the assault, admonishing her for not running away. The family fled to Bangladesh. Two weeks later, K gave birth to her son. I was in immense pain R was at home in late August with her husband and five of her six children when she heard a commotion outside. She saw houses going up in flames in her village. Her husband ran out, but she had the children to take care of. Five soldiers barged into the house. Her children screamed and ran outside. The men stripped off her clothes, took her necklace and kicked her in her back with their knees. Then one of the men began to rape her, while the other four held her down and hit her with their guns. When it was over, they took money and her husbands clothes from the wardrobe. She fled to Bangladesh with her family the next day. She struggled to move with her injuries, and had to use a walking stick. \"I was in immense pain,\" she says, pausing to take a long breath at the memory. \"It hurt so much to walk through the hills.\" Four days later, she arrived in Bangladesh. Allah saved us A was at home praying with her four children in late August when about 50 soldiers surrounded her village and opened fire on the men. A began to shake; she had heard of soldiers raping women in other villages. Three men burst into her house and told her to get out. She refused. They beat her. Her children screamed. The soldiers slapped them, then threw them out of the house. Two of the soldiers hit her until she fell. One pressed his boot against her chest, pinning her down. They took off her jewelry and stripped off her clothes. Then all three raped her, punching and kicking her when she screamed. One pressed a knife to the back of her neck, making her bleed. She still bears a faint scar. After the attack, she bled so heavily she thought she was dying. A farmer told her that her husband had been shot to death, so her brother, mother and daughter helped her make the painful trek to Bangladesh. \"They wanted to wipe us out from the world,\" she says of the military. \"They tried very hard, but Allah saved us.\" In the first few days after the attack, she cried all the time. Now she cries silently in her mind. The baby girl was dead M was at home feeding her son rice in late August when a bullet from the military blasted through the bamboo wall of her house and struck her teenage brother. Her husband and children ran out of the house. But M was 8 months pregnant, and did not want to leave her brother behind. For two days, she stayed by his side, until he died. Soon after, four soldiers charged into her house. They began slapping and punching her. Three soldiers dragged her outside the house, stripped her and beat her. When she screamed, they put a gun in her mouth. The first man began to rape her, while the other two held her down and punched and kicked her pregnant belly. After the second rape, she kicked them so ferociously, they finally left. M felt intense cramping in her belly. She gave birth that night at home. The baby girl was dead. M buried the infant in an unmarked grave by her house. Her husband returned, and they made the three-day walk through the hills to Bangladesh. \"They humiliated us, they destroyed our land and farm, they took our cows, they took our produce,\" she says. \"How would I go back? They destroyed our livelihood.\" When will I have peace? H was reciting the sunrise prayer at home in late August with her husband and six children when she heard a commotion outside. A dozen soldiers burst through her door and started beating her husband. They grabbed three of her children by their feet, carried them outside and bashed them against trees, killing them. Her husband screamed, and H ran out of the house. As she fled, she heard gunshots behind her. She never saw her husband again. She made it with her three other children to the nearby hills, where other women from her village were hiding. But soldiers descended upon the women and dragged them away to rape them. They ripped off Hs clothes, took her jewelry and tied her hands behind her back with her headscarf. One man held her head and hands back, while another held her legs. The third raped her. Then they switched. All three men raped her. Her crying children refused to leave her side during the assault. The soldiers slapped them, kicked them, tried to shove them away. They refused to budge. When the soldiers finished, her 8-year-old daughter tried to cover her naked body with her torn clothing. It took her and her children four days to reach Bangladesh. \"Ive lost my husband, Ive lost my children, Ive lost my country. When will God take me back to my country?\" H says. \"When will I have peace?\" I burn inside for my children When seven soldiers stormed into the house in October, 2016, Ss husband fled. The soldiers began beating her parents. A soldier beat S with his gun, ripped two of her babies from her arms and dropped them on the floor. They tore the clothes off S, her mother and several other young women in the house, and took Ss earrings and money she had hidden in her clothes. Two soldiers took S to a field. They covered her mouth with their hands to stop her screams. They held her down and raped her. When it was over, she hid in the hills but eventually returned home. In August, S was at home with her family when the military began firing rocket launchers at houses, setting them ablaze. Her husband and two eldest children fled, but she stayed behind to pack up her baby girls and a few belongings. One baby was in a swing, the other sleeping on the floor. A rocket launcher hit the house. The babies went up in flames before her eyes. There was nothing she could do. So she ran. She hid with the rest of her family in the hills for several days before making the 3-day trek to Bangladesh. \"I burn inside for my children, but what can I do?\" she asks. \"They burned to death. I guess that was my destiny.\" She told no one The military surrounded Ns village one early morning in late August. Around 18 soldiers stormed her house, and dragged N outside with her sister-in-law and mother-in-law. The women were taken to the center of the village, where soldiers robbed them of their jewelry. Three men then took her to the hills and stripped her naked. Two men held down her hands while a third raped her. Then they switched positions. All three raped her. During the attack, they showed her their knives and beat her. She was too frightened to fight back. When it was over, they left her there. She returned home and told no one about the rape. She was in agony after the assault and bled for eight days. She saw her village burning There was no warning before five soldiers suddenly stormed into 16-year-old Ss house one morning in early August. They searched the home for money and valuables. Then they slashed her husbands neck, killing him. The men briefly left to ransack other neighboring houses, before returning. Two soldiers pulled her into a room, snatched her 3-month-old son from her arms and put him on the floor. They searched her clothes for valuables and took her earrings. Another three men came in and began to beat her with guns while the others stripped off her clothes. One soldier held down her hands, and another put his gun in her mouth. All five men raped her. When she struggled, they beat her. She could hear her baby crying and was terrified the men would kill him. When they were finished, they let her get dressed and then dragged her bleeding body outside to the center of the village. Soldiers were dragging other women they had assaulted out of surrounding houses. The men beat S and the other women again, then left them. S ran back to her house, grabbed her baby and ran. As she fled, she saw soldiers lining men and boys up and shooting them. When she made it to the hills, she looked down and saw her village burning. She never saw her son again The soldiers had been harassing Ts family for days: Showing up and stealing their food, urinating in their rice, hitting T and, once, stripping off her clothes. And then one morning in mid-August, five men dragged her husband out of the house, where they slashed his neck. They grabbed her 10-year-old son and dragged him outside; she never saw him again. Her 12-year-old daughter managed to flee. The soldiers took off Ts earrings and nose ring, then stripped off her clothes. When she screamed, they kicked her. Then they pinned her to the floor. Two men held her while the first man raped her. Then they switched. One man put a gun in her mouth to silence her screams. Afterward, she bled for two days. Months later, her back still hurts from the attack. When they finished, they ate the food in her kitchen and stole her chicken and duck. They also dragged away the body of her husband. She ran into the hills and found her daughter and father. They tried to find safety in neighboring villages, but the military kept showing up. With nowhere to go, they headed toward Bangladesh. All I have left are my words Ns husband was walking down a road in late August when several villagers saw soldiers grab him and drag him into the hills. Later that day, children in the hills came upon his head, along with several other corpses. Soldiers were milling around near the bodies. N stayed in her house with her 8-year-old daughter for the next few days, unable to stop crying. Then suddenly, around 80 soldiers descended on the village. Five soldiers came to her door and shouted: \"Whos inside?\" N was terrified. The men barged in. One man held her as she screamed and fought. They covered her eyes with tape, and hit her head with a gun. Two held her in place while three others began rifling through her clothing. There was nothing for them to steal; shed already hidden her valuables. They ripped her clothes off and beat her in the head with a gun until she blacked out. When she awoke, her vagina was swollen, bleeding and covered in sores. She had clearly been raped; by how many men, she does not know. She was in too much pain that day to leave the house. She and her daughter fled the next day for Bangladesh. She bled for eight days, and three months later still has trouble urinating. \"I have nothing left,\" she says, blinking back tears. \"All I have left are my words.\" She bled for six days N, 17, was at home with her parents and siblings in late August when she heard the crackle of gunfire. Suddenly, 10 men burst into the house. They began slashing open sacks of rice looking for valuables. Then the soldiers tied her hands with rope behind her back and put tape over her mouth. Five of the men held her frantic family back, hitting them with their guns. They ripped off her clothes, snatched her earrings and took the money she had hidden in her new blouse. When she tried to protest, they hit her with their guns. They threw her to the floor. Five men then took turns raping her, while the others helped hold her down. Her parents were forced to watch. When they screamed, the soldiers beat them. Eventually, they stood in silence as their daughter was assaulted. After the men left, Ns parents untied her and washed her. She bled for six days. The family left for Bangladesh the next day. N was in too much pain to walk, so her father carried her over the border. It was just all pain Around 100 soldiers surrounded As village one afternoon in late August. As husband fled, leaving her alone in the house with their 2-year-old son. Two soldiers came into her house. One soldier threw her baby on the floor, then grabbed A by the neck. Both men slapped her and pointed their guns at her. They tore off her clothes. She wept and begged them to stop. One of the men took off her earrings. Then they shoved her to the ground, laughing at her. One soldier pressed his knife to her right hip and cut into her flesh. Both of them punched her in the face. The men then took turns raping her. She could hear her son crying. She prayed to Allah, terrified the men would kill her and her boy. \"It was just all pain,\" she says now. As the soldiers walked out, they fired their guns toward the sky. After the rape, she couldnt eat for days and struggled to walk. She hid in the nearby hills with her son until she found her husband. Together, the family walked for 14 days until they finally crossed the border into Bangladesh. Tearing her flesh with their teeth M was at home with her husband, her sister-in-law and her sister-in-laws brother in late August when security forces stormed their village. The husbands fled, leaving M alone in the house with her sister-in-law, who was in the shower. Three men kicked the door open. They tied Ms arms behind her back. They dragged her sister-in-law out of the shower. They bit her face and body, tearing her flesh with their teeth. All three men raped her, then stabbed her torso and her breasts with their knives, killing her. One of the men came over to M, stripped her clothes off and took her earrings. He unzipped his pants, pushed her down onto her back and then raped her. He choked her and punched her in the face and chest, and bit her eyebrow. She was terrified she would be killed like her sister-in-law. She screamed so loudly that her neighbors came running. The men then fled. She has no plans to return to Myanmar. \"How can I go where there is all this pain and suffering?\" she says. She does not know how they died D was at home one evening in late August when she heard noise outside. Her two older sons and husband rushed out of the house, leaving her alone with her 3-year-old boy. Three men entered her home. She screamed and her son began to cry. They took her nose ring and earrings, then ripped off her clothes. One man restrained her arms and held a knife to her hip while the other two men raped her. She feared the men would kill her, so she stifled her screams. After two hours, the men finally left. When her husband returned, he found her naked. But she was too ashamed to tell him what had happened to her. She was so swollen and bled so much that she found it difficult to walk for nearly three weeks after the rape. They fled to another village. While there, people from her village told her that her home had been burned, and that they had seen the dead bodies of her eldest sons. She does not know how they died. D and her family arrived in Bangladesh in October. It was never-ending It was late August and K was around four months pregnant when soldiers swarmed her village. Four men smashed the door open, tied up her husband and began beating and kicking the couples children. They kicked Ks 3-year-old daughter in the head so hard that she died of her injuries three days later. They dragged Ks husband out of the house and took him to a police station. They snatched the money she had hidden in her blouse and took her earrings. Then they ripped off her clothes. They hit her face and kicked her back. They tied her up and began to rape her, one after the other. The men kicked her so viciously, she feared the baby inside her would die. \"It was never-ending,\" she says now. Just before the men left, they shoved a gun inside her vagina. The pain was excruciating. The next day, a village leader helped raise the money the soldiers demanded to release Ks husband from the police station. In November, K gave birth to a baby boy. He was two months premature, and his skinny arms are barely wider than an adults thumb. K is too malnourished to produce much milk for him, so he is subsisting on sugar water. She feared her baby was dying S was pregnant and at home with her family in late August when 20 soldiers surrounded her village. All the men in the area fled, including her husband. Four soldiers burst into the house, grabbed her two crying toddlers and beat them. She tried to run, but they caught her and dragged her deeper inside the home to a bathing area. One man threatened her with a gun, another with a knife. They ripped her clothes off, and took her gold earrings and gold chain. They threw her to the floor. One man held her left arm, one held her right arm and one held down her legs, while the fourth man raped her. Then they switched. All four men raped her. When she screamed, they threatened to shoot and stab her. They kicked and punched her so hard, she feared the baby inside her was dying. Finally, they left. After the attack, she felt sharp pains in her belly and bled for a month. For two weeks, she thought the baby had died. Finally, she felt something moving inside her. Her husband never returned home. She does not know whether he is dead or alive. If we can live peacefully It was mid-afternoon one day in late August when about 10 men in camouflage uniforms entered Ms house. Her three children began to scream and cry. Five men took her husband away, and four forced her out of the house and into the nearby hills. One of the men held a gun to her. They tore her clothes off and took her earrings. They bit her face and her body and hit her. They tied her mouth with her own headscarf. And then three of the men held her down while the other man raped her. The attack lasted for hours; all four of the men raped her. The men eventually released her and she stumbled back to her house. Her husband was not there. After resting for five days, she took her children and began the three-day journey to Bangladesh. She had to use a walking stick to move her battered body. Despite the horror she endured, she would consider returning to her homeland — if she is assured of her familys safety. \"If we can live peacefully side by side like we do here in Bangladesh, then I will go back,\" she says. Weve had enough torture F was at home in late August when she heard screaming outside. Her husband went to investigate and saw that about 300 soldiers and Buddhist villagers had surrounded the area. The men began burning houses and arresting people. Soldiers separated the men from the women. About eight soldiers and villagers grabbed Fs husband and tied his hands behind his back. They tore off her and her mothers jewelry. Then they took the women outside and set fire to Fs house. Around 100 men took F, her mother and about 20 other women to another village. The soldiers beat them with guns, kicking and slapping them. Once they reached the next village, the women were forced to lie down on the ground next to each other. The men tied their wrists together with rope and began to rape them. Ten men raped F, beat her with their guns, kicked her and slapped her. She could hear her mother crying and calling \"Allah\" as she, too, was raped. It was dark when the men finally left. F managed to wriggle her wrists free of the rope and ran into a field. In the morning, she returned to search for her mother, but she had vanished. She saw at least five women lying dead on the ground, their throats cut. She has no idea what has become of her husband. And she cannot imagine returning to her homeland. \"Weve had enough torture,\" she says. She does not know if her husband is alive S was lying in bed with her husband and son after dinner in late August when around 10 soldiers burst into the house. A few took her husband outside. Five stayed behind, and one pointed his gun at her. She tried to run, but they grabbed her and kicked her back, stomach and chest. They stripped off her clothes and took her necklace and earrings. Three men raped her. Her young son began to cry. A soldier pointed his gun at the child and he screamed louder. S was in agony. After the men were finished, they took her outside, naked. Her son followed them. About two dozen other women, also naked, had been dragged outside as well. The soldiers forced the women to march toward a rice paddy, beating and kicking them as they walked. S felt blood running down her legs. Once they arrived, the men ordered them to lie down. S fought back and soldiers kicked her. She fell to the ground. Three more soldiers began to rape her. When at last the assault was over, S fled back toward her house with her son, only to find her home had been burned along with many others. She does not know if her husband is alive.','WORLD-SOUTH-ASIA','','2017-12-11 13:49:00','AP | Dec 11, 2017, 13:49 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:31'),(566,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ayodhya-dispute-shia-boardchief-akhahra-parisad-president/articleshow/61620879.cms','Ayodhya dispute: Shia board chief meets Akhahra Parisad president','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-61621907,width-400,resizemode-4/61621907.jpg]','AYODHYA: A late entrant to join efforts to find an amicable solution to the vexed Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, UP Shia Waqf Board chief Waseem Rizvi, on Sunday visited Ayodha to meet some key players from both Hindu and Muslim sides.

Low humidity, high wind velocity and low temperature helped the state capital to come out from the severe category. However, with AQI of 374, Lucknows air quality is far from satisfactory and remains very poor. According to the Air Quality Index (AQI) data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for 44 cities in the country, pollution levels in Lucknow dropped down by 50 units from Saturday. Since November 8, the city AQIs had been more than 400 or severe. It crossed 450 on November 9 and 10. On Friday, the pollution level reduced to 424. \"Lucknows air has improved because of weather factors like low relative humidity, high wind velocity recorded 4 metre/second as compared to the earlier of 0.16 metre/second and later 1 metre/second and temperature as low as 25 degree Celsius,\" said Prof Dhruv Singh from Lucknow Universitys geology department. He said there was negligible smog on Saturday and condition was expected to improve in the coming days. Singh said, \"The air quality might have improved from severe to very poor but pollutants are still present above permissible limits and can cause respiratory illnesses on prolonged exposure. The public should make sure not to burn garbage, should opt for public transport and follow traffic rules so roads are free from jams. This will help bring down pollution level\". According to the live air quality monitoring station of CPCB, the concentration of toxic substances in the atmosphere were comparatively low throughout the day on Sunday.

She told cops that she was in kitchen when she heard gunshots. \"On rushing towards Martinas room on second floor, I saw Rakesh coming down,\" she told investigators. Devi also told police that no one else was present in the house except herself, Martina and Rakesh when the incident took place. \"We arrested Rakesh on the basis of Maltis complaint,\" said inspector PGI AK Rai. Rakesh told police that he wanted Martina to get married but she showed no interest.

Part of a large posse of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel posted at Delhi airport, she frisked female passengers in the security queue, her posture erect, and her gaze alert. The crisp fit of her khaki uniform, with the shirt flatly tucked into high-waist trousers, the androgynous toughness of her brown boots, the broad, buckled belt, the hair pulled into a bun under a smart cap, exuded a power that many women in trendy clothes and clutching designer bags would envy. She wore her job well. Compared to state police uniforms, the CISFs khaki and combat versions have sharper cuts and better tailoring. But their power doesnt just come from the fit. In the words of deputy commandant (PRO) Manjit Singh, \"The uniform symbolises the mental transition of an officer from being a civilian to being part of a security force\". A young CISF officer posted at the Race Course metro station says its her way of leaving her conventional middle-class married life behind. In fact, she adds that it not only works as a confidence booster for her but also for her mother and aunts, a generation that could never even step out of the sari unless they retired to their rooms. With the extension of the Delhi Metro routes, these female officers in their smart vardis will become even more visible. At present, CISF, which falls under the ministry of home affairs, has 8,243 women recruits across India, making up 5.5% of its total strength. This is the largest number of women personnel among all Central Armed Police Forces. In Delhi, CISF women personnel are deployed at the Metro, the airport and at government buildings. Their uniforms are made of dip-dyed polyester viscose; a disruptive pattern in the khaki palette is presently used for combat gear. One khaki sari-blouse set is also assigned to every woman officer but Singh admits it is hardly an option when weapons have to be carried on belts. The sari is preferred only by pregnant officers and those on office duties. While uniforms are distributed in standard sizes — small, medium, large and XL — officers are free to take them to a private tailor for a customised fit?.? The force has trained tailors at most of its 336 installations, who measure and cut the fabric. These are then stitched by women, often wives of force personnel, at family welfare centres of CISF. Grooming tips, too, are part of the training. While heavy jewellery is not permitted for field duties, Singh says keeping cultural sensitivities in mind, small pieces of jewellery are allowed, for instance, for newly married women. Given the androgynous appeal of military uniforms ?and their make-do and mend practicality ?derived from wartime exigencies, fashion has for ages been inspired by camouflage prints, jackets with brass buttons, khaki shirts with epaulettes, belts, ankle boots, caps and aviator glasses. Some experiments have boomeranged of course. In 2014, fast fashion brand H&M had to apologise for olive green jumpsuits allegedly modelled on the uniforms of female Kurdish officers fighting the ISIS in Iraq and Syria. But that didnt deter the design movement from combat style. Sometimes it mirrors fascinating arches of creativity as in the work of the infamously famous designer John Galliano?s layered military themes; at other times, it is stylishly pragmatic as interpreted by athleisure brands. Ten days ago, 19-year-old American TV star Kylie Jenner, the youngest to join the Forbes list of 100 highest paid celebrities, added a Camo Collection with camouflage sports bras and panties to her eponymous line of merchandise, nailing a million-plus likes on Instagram. Curiously enough, no Indian designer has explored a full collection inspired by the khaki uniform, perhaps discouraged by the Indian consumers love for decorative wear. Before the move to change police uniforms, which are in the process of getting an NID makeover, perhaps Indian fashion will pay tribute to the forces smartly turned out female officers?','HOME-SELF-GOALS-A-BIGGER-THREAT-TO-BJP-THAN-OPPONENT-RAHUL','Shefalee Vasudev','2017-06-18 01:00:00','| TNN | Jun 18, 2017, 01:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:42'),(573,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/self-goals-a-bigger-threat-to-bjp-than-opponent-rahul/how-these-smart-students-are-jumping-over-social-hurdles/articleshow/59196259.cms','How these smart students are jumping over social hurdles','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59196269,width-400,resizemode-4/59196269.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/59196290/Master.jpg]','Youve read the headlines — samosa sellers son makes it to IIT, daily wagers child clears JEE Advanced. Behind these heart-warming stories are a bunch of institutes which are steering under-privileged kids to success All of 24 and still in her last year at IIT Kharagpur, Poonam Gupta is the founder and CEO of Alive Home, an internet-of-things startup. Her family lives in Delhis Geeta Colony, six people sharing a single room. Gupta studied at the Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, a school for gifted students run by the Delhi government. She wanted to be an astronaut, an actress, join the army — but like many clever Indian students, eventually found herself aiming for the IITs. \"Im a first-generation learner, my family didnt understand my need to study so much. There were always chores and interruptions and obligations,\" she says. Her family — her father didnt have a steady job — didnt believe she could crack the JEE, and neighbours told them she should just get married. But Poonam did make it to IIT Kharagpur in 2012, thanks to the time, teaching and peer-group she found at the Centre for Learning and Social Responsibility (CSRL) Super 30 in Delhi. In the lottery of life, the odds are against you if youre from a village or an urban slum, if you havent been to an English-medium school, and if your parents dont have a high school education. Less than 3% of the engineering and business school intake is from rural schools. But now, there is a tidal wave of teaching programmes dedicated to helping smart students into professional institutions. The most famous of these is Super 30. An initiative started in Patna in 2002, it picks 30 smart students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and strenuously trains them for the joint entrance exams (JEE Main and Advanced) to IIT and other engineering schools. The original Super 30 has split into two; the school run by Anand Kumar continues to work out of one site in Patna, and posts record victories. Meanwhile, the branch under retired IPS officer Abhayanand has sprouted many others, like the Rahmani Super 30 meant for Muslim students. It has also partnered with public sector units across the country under the canopy of the Centre for Social Responsibility and Learning (CSRL). Theres a GAIL Super 30 in Kanpur, a Petronet Super 40 in Kashmir, a Railtel Akanksha Super 30 in Uttarakhand. Now, with 13 centres across the country, it has helped 550 students make it to various IITs, central and state engineering institutes in the last seven years, says CSRL director S K Shahi. \"Theres huge talent trapped in the lower half of the pyramid, which doesnt get a fair chance to get to top positions in any walk of life,\" says Anirudh Krishna, public policy professor at Duke University and author of The Broken Ladder: The Paradox and Potential of Indias One Billion. \"Super 30 was the catalyst that showed what was possible,\" he says. Rohit Srivastava, a chemical engineer who shuttles between Dehradun and Srinagar to teach chemistry in these institutes, would agree. Having taught at Kota before, he says it isnt so much about any X factor in the teaching as much as \"motivating students to see the value of an engineering career\". Abhayanand, who is the academic mentor to these schools and teaches physics, says his inspiration is the scientist Richard Feynman. \"In India, the approach is that the childs mind is empty, the teachers mind is full\" — but his method is to get students to understand the logic, and hone their own problem-solving abilities. Most of these students are a first in their families. None of them have the home environment, schools and tuition, or even leisure that middle-class students take for granted. Except for a driven few, most of them didnt even dream of IIT. \"But once they get in, they inspire others around them to do the same,\" says Anand Kumar. Super 30 has been a trailblazer, but there are many such access initiatives across India. Mumbai has Avanti, an IIT Bombay alum initiative. In Pune, Dakshana has been working since 2007 with underprivileged students, and got 67 out of its 69 students through JEE Advanced this year. In Kashmir, the Rise Institute has been working to hook up bright kids with better opportunities. \"More than economic problems, Kashmiri students lack hope. They are expected to settle for mediocrity,\" says founder Mubeen Masudi. While they primarily groom students for technical exams like JEE, they also try to answer other needs, like the SAT. They find role models that young people can relate to, whether Kashmiri journalists or civil servants or chartered accountants. The school works around curfews and internet blocks, gets friends to ferry learning material across from Delhi, for instance. \"The idea is to ignite optimism and get them to rely on their own hard work independent of the atmosphere,\" says Masudi. Such social-mobility-promoting organisations are only going to increase, says Krishna, and \"there needs to be synergy between the state and society\". Right now, CSRL Super 30s draws the bulk of its students from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, the school network for talented kids from rural low-income backgrounds. Many state governments also do free coaching for the JEE. In Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, one of the poorest districts in India, as many as 55 SC/ST students cracked JEE Advanced, thanks to the district administrations efforts. Its a ripple effect, \"Once one student makes it to a professional institute, it will make his or her neighbour also think that it is possible,\" says zila parishad CEO Anurag Chowdhury, an IIT grad himself. If education is to deliver true change, rather than merely reproduce social hierarchies, these efforts are vital. And a more diverse classroom makes for better learning, for everyone. Opening the doors to an elite law education: While the gates to IIT must be flung open wider, other fields also need diversity. When Shamnad Basheer, then teaching law at NUJS Kolkata, was talking to his students about agriculture, he realised that not one of them knew what that experience was like. \"It just struck me, that for all the talk about the Constitution, inclusion and equality, we dont represent 95% of the country.\" And so, in 2010, he started IDIA (Increasing Diversity by Increasing Access) which reached out to under-represented groups in high schools, and talked them into a law career. Starting with a few students in Pelling, western Sikkim, \"who wanted to be bus drivers or farmers, and never thought of law\", they took basic aptitude tests, swung coaching classes and learning material and for entrance tests, provided mentorship and social support after their students entered various national law schools. IDIA scaled dramatically to 23 cities, because it is volunteer-driven. \"Its the ISIS model — totally decentralised, anyone can take up the cause,\" jokes Basheer. The law, with its connection to public leadership, needs self-representation by disadvantaged groups — \"Why should legal aid be about our generosity, when people can advocate their own causes much better,\" asks Basheer. One of the students they found is 23-year-old Karthika Annamalai, now a corporate lawyer at AZB & Partners. Her mother was a stone quarry worker, who earned Rs 3,000 a month. She describes how she wanted to be a lawyer, after hearing about a case where a landlord cut off the tongue of a bonded labourer — but it was only after IDIAs Bangalore team gave a pitch at her school that the prospect became real. Annamalai may have chosen a practical career route, but she can also address her communitys problems with ease; the panchayat took her dead-seriously when she spoke up for labourers in a dispute back home.','HOME-SELF-GOALS-A-BIGGER-THREAT-TO-BJP-THAN-OPPONENT-RAHUL','','2017-06-18 13:19:00','TNN | Updated: Jun 18, 2017, 13:19 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:45'),(574,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/self-goals-a-bigger-threat-to-bjp-than-opponent-rahul/indias-new-museums-are-more-about-memories-than-objects/articleshow/59302578.cms','India’s new museums are more about memories than objects','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59302554,width-400,resizemode-4/59302554.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/59302579/Master.jpg]','All these years, the Partition of India and Pakistan, the biggest mass migration in the last century, has been confined to refugee accounts and nightmares, literature and cinema, and lived on in the fears and longings of later generations. There was no physical memorial anywhere to Partition — perhaps because it was seen as too flammable, too painful. Now, 70 years on, a small museum in Amritsars Town Hall marks the traumatic event which led to 12 million people crossing the border, and killing somewhere between one and two million. \"Its a peoples museum,\" says co-founder and CEO Mallika Ahluwalia. \"Its not about assigning blame, but to acknowledge the experience of those who lived through it.\" It is their voices and memories that echo in the four rooms of the museum currently open for viewers. In one of the rooms, an installation of a well is a quiet reminder of the violence, rape and honour killings of women. At another point in the room, a still-brilliant Phulkari coat and a battered leather briefcase tell a painful love story. The Partition Museum is still very much in beta — it will open all its rooms to the public on August 17. While the material first came from the personal networks of its founders and trustees, Kishwar Desai, Dipali Khanna, Bindu Manchanda and Ahluwalia herself, all from Partition-affected families, she says they were overwhelmed with the stories that poured in. The museums visitors book has others offering more personal accounts. \"We want to do an oral history archive, one where anyone can come and search, perhaps hear their great-grandparents voice,\" says Ahluwalia. The Partition Museum is one of several memory museums that have sprung up around the country. They flip the logic of traditional museums, where you go to look at objects and exhibits — here, the objects are made meaningful only because of the events and experiences they emerge from. The Remember Bhopal museum is about the survivors of the 1984 gas tragedy telling their own story, in sharp counterpoint to official versions. \"The museum is not meant to evoke pity or anger alone, but also their ongoing protest, their fight and resolve,\" says museologist and journalist Rama Lakshmi, who curated the museum. The objects are not showpieces — they include the inhaler of a woman with respiratory illness who marched all the way to Delhi, the bangle broken when an activist was jailed. Rusted locks and corroded utensils speak of the damage of the gas tragedy, the betrayal of its survivors. The Conflictorium museum in Mirzapur, Ahmedabad makes a more oblique point about the conflicts and differences that make us. There is no explicit mention of the 2002 riots, but the museum calls for an examination of political, social and personal conflict. A room with the silhouettes of leaders like Gandhi, Ambedkar, Nehru, Jinnah, Sardar Patel and Indula Yagnik, with red lines running between them, is also a reminder that these figures and their thoughts were often in argument and opposition. \"These criss-crossings exist, and theyre fine. Thats the beauty of the Union of India, that there is no coherent idea but many thoughts that collide and come together,\" says Avni Sethi, founder of the museum. None of these museums are encyclopaedias pinned to the wall, or storehouses of objects — they are meant to make you feel, to engage the senses and the imagination. \"There are 22 museums in Ahmedabad, and hardly anyone visits, so why another one? Maybe were not a museum-going culture, maybe were more oral and tactile. So we did away with traditional museum etiquette. There are no yellow lines or glass boxes, you can touch and feel and add and subtract to the displays,\" says Sethi. The museum is not about the exhibits alone — its a dynamic space, with movie screenings, poetry readings and stand-up gigs. \"In India, weve only known the British model of collections exhibited like trophies, a sculpture gallery, a numismatics gallery and so on. We need more storytelling in museums,\" says museum designer Amardeep Behl. For that to happen, historians, designers and storytellers must first think together, then get the specialized curators in, he says. \"One needs to create immersive experiences to trigger emotions. Its about the design, rather than the technology or the text,\" says Shekhar Badve, who has designed the Swaraj museum in Pune dedicated to early freedom fighters, among others. The day the Bhopal museum opened, one of the women cried for hours, in front of her own infant sons frock in a display case, says Lakshmi. She had donated it to the museum herself, not so long ago, but something about seeing it aestheticized, lit up, with his picture and her voice telling the story, just devastated her. Many of the survivors are taken back to their own experience that awful midnight, in the pitch black of the first room in the museum. Remember Bhopal Museum The last room in the Conflictorium has a \"map of feelings\" with hooks where you can place bangles, to describe your own complicated responses to each exhibit. \"We dont want the visit to be input-input-input, you want people to pause and process,\" says Sethi. Those with direct memories of events are often overwhelmed in these museums, but it can unsettle other visitors too. In the Partition Museum, the gallery of hope features a tree where people write messages on paper leaves, and many of those are jingoistic \"East or West India is the best\", \"Salute to our soldiers\" and so on, while a few are more reflective, moved by what they just saw. Of course, these museums are still new and few, and have to walk a careful line. \"Museums can be a space of genuine reflection on conflict only if they are truly autonomous. The British Museum can host a discussion on the Middle East only because the government keeps a distance. In India, its harder for museums, public or private, to take on contentious political subjects,\" says Ruchira Ghose, former director of Crafts Museum. Theres a twee quality that often creeps in when complex confrontations of trauma are ruled out, says art critic and curator Ranjit Hoskote. \"In a society that is afraid of confronting its own spectres, there are limits to what a memory museum can do,\" he points out.','HOME-SELF-GOALS-A-BIGGER-THREAT-TO-BJP-THAN-OPPONENT-RAHUL','Amulya Gopalakrishnan','2017-06-25 01:00:00','| TNN | Jun 25, 2017, 01:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:47'),(575,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/self-goals-a-bigger-threat-to-bjp-than-opponent-rahul/neem-in-your-knickers/articleshow/59302245.cms','Neem in your knickers','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59302214,width-400,resizemode-4/59302214.jpg]','Silk and satin are passe. Nylon and polyester are sweaty and bad for the planet. Its no surprise that designers are experimenting with sustainable fabric when it comes to innerwear. And its not just any eco-friendly material. Lingerie fashioned from fabric soaked in turmeric, dipped in neem and infused with Indian madder (a flowering plant) is making its way from southern Indias shores to boutiques in Britain and online stores in Australia and Japan. In Japan, Sachiko Betsumeis ayurvedic Haramaki or belly-warming underwear as she calls it, is fast gaining popularity. The aromatherapist, who discovered ayurvedic clothing at a shop in Kovalam, while backpacking in Kerala in 2014, has just launched her online store. \"All the products (socks, panties, bras) are made of organic cotton or linen infused with ayurvedic herbs such as sappan wood, turmeric, tulsi, triphala etc,\" says Betsumei. She began selling at exhibitions and found there was a demand for it. \"There is a growing interest in ayurveda in Japan and while people may find it difficult to follow the diet and lifestyle that goes with it, they are eager to try ayurvedic clothing,\" she says. Ayurvedic lingerie, and clothing in general is getting popular across the world. It was way back in 2006 that the Directorate of Handloom and the Government Ayurveda College, Kerala, launched Ayurvastra — an initiative to promote handloom fabric dyed with medicinal herbs. Today, most of the foreign enterprises procure this fabric from Kairali Exports in Balaramapuram, Kerala. Though the handloom firm initially worked with the dyeing team of the Ayurvastra project, they now have their own facilities in Erode and Tiruppur. According to them, its just a return to the roots. \"Earlier, all clothes were dyed with natural dyes. Chemical dyes came in later and they are harmful to the wearer as well as the environment,\" says T Kumar of Kairali Exports. Christine Snow, who lives in Bath, UK, supplies herb-infused undies to 20 outlets and three online stores. The beneficial properties of natural plant extracts are slowly released and absorbed into the skin when the cloth comes into contact through body heat, she claims. Indian madder has anti-inflammatory properties and is good for skin disorders, according to her. \"The herb also gives the cloth its lovely pink hue,\" says Snow. \"Neem is renowned for its antiseptic properties and gives relief from eczema and skin irritations,\" she adds. Snow sells Indian madder, neem, and turmeric knickers, at £10 each (Rs 820), on her website, www.keralacrafts.co.uk. Other products include herb-infused shawls and scarves. The fabric is sourced from Balaramapuram, the garments are designed by Snow, and women of an NGO in Kerala make them. \"There has been a good marriage between traditional Indian craftsmanship using styles that are marketable in the UK,\" says Snow. In Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, designer Julie Lantry launched Soulmate Intimates, a range of ayurvedic underwear, in 2014. \"Our certified organic cotton and organic cotton/lycra is produced and dyed in Tiruppur. The fabric is then transported to Bengaluru where it is transformed into quality intimates by using advanced technology,\" says Lantry. It is then sent to artisans in Bengaluru for embellishments like block prints and embroidery. \"Clients love this sustainable feminine charm,\" she says. At present, she makes underwear for women, including bras, knickers and tank tops, which are sold online at prices ranging from 22-79 Australian dollars (Rs 1,070-3,850). \"Women with sensitive skin and clients going through chemotherapy, for example, buy our intimates,\" she says. Others like the fact that its eco-friendly. Doctors, however, do not fully endorse the health benefits of this herbal fabric. \"I am not sure exactly how it works or how beneficial it is,\" says Chennai-based dermatologist Dr Maya Vedamurthy. Despite the lack of scientific studies on the subject, the positive response from buyers has encouraged entrepreneurs to expand their collections. Lantry plans intimates for men and children as well as outerwear. Betsumei has begun making sanitary napkins out of the cloth as \"disposable pads contain a lot of chemicals.\" Now, its just a matter of time before a certain yoga guru-turned-FMCG king cottons on to this trend.','HOME-SELF-GOALS-A-BIGGER-THREAT-TO-BJP-THAN-OPPONENT-RAHUL','Priya Menon','2017-06-25 01:00:00','| TNN | Jun 25, 2017, 01:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:48'),(576,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/self-goals-a-bigger-threat-to-bjp-than-opponent-rahul/move-over-snapchat-its-cab-chat-doing-the-rounds/articleshow/59086859.cms','Move over Snapchat, its Cab Chat doing the rounds','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59086905,width-400,resizemode-4/59086905.jpg]','Jostling for space amid food porn, cat videos, and airport \"check-ins\" is a new breed of social media posts — the cab story. A drivers off-hand yet deeply philosophical observation, the driver with an engineering degree driving just for kicks, the cabbie working double shifts just to send his kids abroad — riders tripping on a fab cab story want to spread the word. And there have never been so many. But then, thanks to app-based aggregators, cabs have never been such a popular mode of transport. Ola and Uber together completed about 500 million rides in India in 2016, according to a market research report. The change is succinctly summarised in this tweet from @Carols10cents: \"1998: Dont get in strangers cars — Dont meet ppl from internet. 2016: Literally summon strangers from internet to get in their car.\" Predictably enough it had over one lakh retweets. And if internet technology summons the cab, internet technology makes the ride social. Have Facebook account, will post cab conversation. \"People love to read these stories. Earlier too, people would have these experiences, but they were not writing about it. It is a trend that has started now,\" says Ajay Maurya, who launched the website, mycabstory.com, which crowdsources and collates cab and autorickshaw stories — from both passengers and drivers. \"I used to commute a lot and I realised the drivers have so many stories to tell. I have some friends who get into cabs and just put on their headphones. I like to sit in the front and talk to the drivers. Sitting at the back just creates a divide,\" says the 24-year old web developer from Mumbai. Comedians too have found a ticket to ride. Late last year, East India Comedy uploaded comedian Sapan Vermas set on an Uber cabbie called Damodar, whose Starbucks-frequenting and Nucleya-listening coolness inspired awe. The same year, comedians Kanan Gill and Naveen Richard uploaded a sketch, \"Calling a Cab\", where a passenger struggles to direct a cab driver to his location, and the driver finally drives off to outer space, among other places. But what makes the cab story so enduring? Relatability, Verma supposes. \"Its like cracking a local train joke in Mumbai — people get it. Most youngsters today use these cabs. I dont think we had as many conversations earlier,\" he says. But its not just the passenger telling all the cab stories, some drivers too have special encounters to report. Gagandeep Singh drives for Ola Cabs. The 37-year-old, who doesnt drive as much as he used to, runs 14 cabs in Delhi. He calls himself a \"Stepney\" — fills in when required. And the requirement mostly arises from boredom, or when he wants to meet new people. And hes met quite a few already, like his favourite RJ, and the physiotherapist of the under-17 Indian cricket team. He recalls a couple he dropped off at the airport — an Egyptian man and a Mexican woman. They were to part ways there, and they cried the entire way. \"I passed them some tissues, and told them everything was going to be okay. The Egyptian man hugged me tight before he left. He even phoned me later,\" says Singh. Not all cab stories are upbeat. Bengaluru-based journalist Sandhya Menon recently shared a story on Twitter. This was from a cabbie complaining of the disturbing frequency with which drunken passengers throw up and pass out in his cab. Nasty experiences from passengers are all too common as well. In March this year a Delhi woman shared a harrowing experience of being harassed by a cab driver who misused the app and even posed as customer care when she tried filing a complaint. One things for sure, it is far more common to come across cab stories narrated by passengers than the other way around. Websites and Facebook pages like thebetterindia.com and Humans of Bombay have tried to even things out by having cabbies and autorickshaw drivers narrate their own stories. \"To me, shamefully, it is a matter of privilege. You often dont see the driver as a human being who is just like you. When you have a conversation where you realise that the cabbie is just like you, and you think, let me tweet this — it often comes from a place of condescension,\" says Menon. \"We have to realise that the person behind the wheel is not an automaton. They are real people with a story,\" adds Maurya. Journalists, admittedly, have been some of the worst offenders in the pre-social-media-cab-story-sharing department. In 2006, Pulitzer-winning author and journalist Thomas Friedman wrote about a cab driver in France being \"too busy\" speaking into his Bluetooth headset to chitchat with him. \"You know the old story, As my Parisian taxi driver said to me about the French elections ... Well, you can forget about reading columns starting that way anymore. My driver was too busy to say hello, let alone opine on politics,\" he wrote in his New York Times column. Now to know what the driver thought about the ride... SHARING CABS, AND CHINWAGS Riding to the rescue A Mumbai cabbie saw some drunk men catcalling and chasing a woman on the street. He immediately drove towards her, honked repeatedly to scare off the men, and offered to drop her home. \"We drove in silence for those 2-3 minutes...her house was just around the corner, but when she stepped out, she caught both my hands, started weeping and thanked me over and over again,\" he told Humans of Bombay, a popular Facebook page. \"She insisted that I wait outside while she went in to get something. She came out with a tin of rasgullas and told me to take them home to my family — I thanked her and left. I barely knew her for 10 minutes, but I dont think Ill ever forget that night,\" he said. Custodian of lost phones Between 2004 and 2014, Gadadhar Mandal claims to have returned 14 cellphones to passengers who left them in his car. He says he usually calls a frequently dialled number from the phone, or receives calls on it to figure out who owns it. He recalled one episode for thebetterindia.com when he returned a phone to a couple. \"The couple was so impressed that they invited me home for dinner and showed a lot of respect. I worked with them for nine years after that. This episode taught me that even one act of honesty helps you gain respect.\" The driver with a secret A passenger from Delhi had a story of a cab driver who eloped and married against his in-laws wishes, pushed his wife to pursue her fashion designing dream in Dubai while he set up a CCTV business. Frequent China trips, latest gadgets, they had it all. But then, hard times fell. \"I suffered huge losses and now Im on the streets. I am driving this cab because I wanted to do something respectful with my life. I went from having a driver to being one — but it is okay. Good times will come again. Nobody except my wife knows about this,\" he told the passenger.

My husband was 31, taught English to college students in Mangalore, and came across as a progressive man. But what I had seen as an uncompromising idealism soon revealed itself as an absurdly high tendency to be a control freak. The anger he exhibited towards injustice turned into brutal rage against me. I stood up against him, retorted sharply in our fights, but my resistance only escalated the spiral of violence. Why do women stay in abusive relationships? A question I am often forced to consider. The reason is always something outside of the abused woman: Family. Society. Shame. Children. Hope. Fear. A mistaken belief that there will be a better tomorrow, that the wife-beater will somehow reform himself. It is an endless list. Every time my inner voice urged me to walk away, a mix of reason and emotion held me back: How will my parents break this news to others? Should I give my husband another chance? Will my family not be disgraced? Will I ever be able to have a public life in a conservative society where divorcees are shamed? And more frightening than any of these questions: Will he hunt me down and kill me if I leave him? There is nothing new about these questions—these are the same fears and doubts that keep innumerable women from leaving bad relationships. Before any of this had happened, before my husband, before the violence, the world was full of grand dreams. I was a strong woman who openly identified as a feminist, who cared about the world but did not care what the world thought about her. Instead, I ended up a victim. Frightened of a man, deferential to his demands. I stopped writing. I stopped living. I was only surviving. Marriage, within a short span of four months, had constrained me to a space between the bedroom and the kitchen. Under the ruse of protecting his revolutionary life, I was systematically cut off from the world: phone, email, social media, and prevented (sometimes cajoled, sometimes threatened) from getting a job. Now, looking back, I can see that it is a method adopted by abusive men everywhere to make their wives feel besieged and helpless. They begin to shrink a womans world, leave her entirely at their mercy. As the violence intensified, I began to feel that his beatings would one day lead to my death at his hands. So, I ran away on January 10, 2012, from my marital home in Mangalore back to the protection of my parents place in Chennai. My husband tried his best to get me back: withholding my educational certificates as ransom in the hope that I would be unemployable, taking the dispute into wider family circles, bemoaning my upbringing to everyone, and indulging in even more slander. But I paid no heed. I plunged headlong into my writing. The one subject on which I wasnt yet ready to be bold, however, was talking about my marriage. I left that quietly in the grave where I had buried it. When the December 2012 Delhi gang-rape and murder happened, everywhere around me was the talk of rapists: who they were, what punishment they deserved, how to make our streets safe for women. We were having these huge demonstrations against rape but we were living with abusive men in our midst all the time. In India, husbands forcing their wives to have sex are not committing a legal offence. Wife-beating is seen as well-deserved—statistically, even a majority of young people think that a husband is justified in hitting his wife. The cultural sanction of rape and domestic violence was all around us, and we were sheltering these men with our silence. I knew that I had been one among millions of nameless, faceless, helpless women who do not speak out, who suffer unheard. I knew that nothing is ever changed without voices demanding that change. To confess, I had no idea how painful it would be to write the story of my marriage. Everything I remembered was something I had wanted to forget. When I talk to people about writing my story, the first response is often: have you found the writing cathartic? Not at all. Catharsis is about purging emotions. That was never my aim. Instead, I wanted to take all that hurt and pain and shame and suffering, and distil it and transform it into something beautiful. The process of writing was a kind of alchemy-to take the horror of the violence, to dwell in it and shape that into an intense, moving sentence. I did that until every shard of my sadness caught the right amount of light, and every word shone on the page. I made an abusive marriage into an art object, and that is how I left it in the end.

It was a smash-up of ivide oru aal or one man here. There were other men around the house but only one ivdoral. Inspired, the family knighted him Sir Ivdarhal for his polite, measured ways. My grandmother was more direct — Maniyande achha, Maniyans father, was how she referred to her husband. One daughter-in-law, altogether too modern for the 1970s, dared call her husband by his name the day she arrived as a bride. The backlash was swift: \"Is he her playmate? The arrogance!\" Today, chetta, dominates the scene in Kerala. A bit bewildering because it is the Malayalam equivalent of dada, or older brother, and sounds rather incestuous. The substitute-for-name assortment also includes ivide (here), ketto (do you hear) and so on. And that is the story across communities in India — elaborately circuitous modes of getting around the taboo of naming ones husband, to his face as well as when referring to him. Many women in the metros are absolutely cool with naming their husbands, even an oye is okay. But step out of the cosmopolitan circle — even into conservative urban homes — and you realise that taking the pati ka naam is a transgression, sometimes severely punishable. To get a sense of how little things have actually changed in much of India, watch Why Can Women Not Name Their Husbands, a video quickie shot early this year in Belwa Karkhandar, a village in Kashipur district of Uttar Pradesh, by Video Volunteers (VV). Why do you not call your husbands by their names, asks Madhuri Chauhan, a community correspondent with VV, of a small gathering of married women, young and old. \"Pati bhagwan ka roop hota hai...devta ke saman hota hai...mai baap hota hai\" — a husband deserves respect reserved for the almighty and he cant be named. But he can name you? \"He has the adhikar...we are smaller than our husbands...he is maibaap, can do anything,\" come the answers. VV is a platform for alternate and marginalised voices, especially on gender issues. Chauhan and 56 others like her are working on the theme of everyday patriarchy across small towns and villages. The young dulhans of Belwa Karkhandar, says Chauhan, would like to call their husbands by their names. \"We want to be friends with them. Par buzurgon se darte hain,\" they tell her. Some are bold enough to speak the name when asked but only outside their village and out of the hearing of familiar elders. Video Volunteers then decided to use the film made earlier this year to hold discussions at its gender groups. It found that even naming an uncle-in-law was an act of outrage in very conservative rural pockets. In Odisha, Malati Mahato from a hamlet in Sundergarh paid the price for her impudence by being declared a social outcaste by a kangaroo court. \"A woman shouldnt name husband or her in laws,\" decrees an elderly village woman justifying Mahatos continued boycott for a year and a half. But in Walhe village, off Pune, VV community correspondent Rohini Pawar shrugged off her fears and decided to take the lead. \"Prakash,\" she called out to her husband. When the bomb dropped, there was stunned silence. \"I told him if we are living together as equals so why not? When we are alone, now I can call him by his name but not before the joint family or out in the village,\" she says. At the discussion group Pawar organized, some women decided to go ahead and name their husbands. Pawar captured their emotions in a video called Whats in a Name? The rest of Walhe isnt happy going by comments like: \"These women go out too much...theyve become too shaani...haath se bahar...kya sikha diya?\" So why cant women name their husbands? In Divine Passions, The Construction of Social Emotions in India, edited by Owen Lynch in 1985, scholar Margaret Trawick talks of her journeys into the interior Tamil Nadu to understand The Ideology of Love in a Tamil Family. She found that the avoidance of the spouses name in favour of \"father of so-and- so\" or even caste name (my Reddiar) and other arch references were part of a convention of \"hiding love\" to protect it from unknown harm. Scholar Pauline Kolenda who went to Western UP found that women referred to their husbands as malik or voh \"not so much a matter of deference as of sexual embarrassment\". Will getting women to take their husbands name change much? \"Some aspects of everyday patriarchy are so deeply embedded in us we dont even register them as such. The fact is that these symbols of matrimony that we are questioning through our groups - the ghoonghat, the vermillion, the rituals - are all the womens domain. Just getting women to talk about these small things means ceding them some thought. Change can come only after questions are raised,\" says Pawar.

On Fathers Day, Sunday Times profiles some progressive papas who are rewiring their work life to spend more time with their kids IT professional Punit Shrivastava was a weekend dad not long ago. On workdays, he would usually get home only in time to see his son Iham fast asleep. Not any more. For the last six months, this 44-year-old has used the flexi-time option at work so that he can help wife Amrita, who works at a Hyderabad-based MNC, get their seven-year-old dressed and ready for school, and be back in time to take him for tennis lessons and give him a snack, before logging back on the computer in the evening to finish his work. He also takes care of the boy when Amrita travels for work which is 10-12 days a month. \"It is exhausting but I chose to do this,\" says Shrivastava, \"For two years when Iham went to daycare, I barely had any time with him. When I asked him how his school day was, I would get mechanical answers. It is only when you spend time with your child that they open up. It means my work gets stretched out through the day but there are no regrets.\" Shrivastava is not the only one. Though still a small minority, some Indian men are breaking the mould to become the primary caregiver to their children. Writer and stand-up comedian Sumankumar R gave up his IT job to change diapers and cook for his then one-year-old daughter, Aadya. \"The first thing I did was call my mother to apologise for never realising how tough her job was. She raised me and two brothers single-handedly, and here I thought just feeding my daughter should be considered an Olympic sport,\" he says. \"The first thing I did was call my mother to apologise for never realising how tough her job was. She raised me and two brothers single-handedly, and here I thought just feeding my daughter should be considered an Olympic sport, Sumankumar R says with Aadya Gautam John, who stayed at home for two years between 2014 and 2016 to take care of his daughter, said that like women, men too face restrictions on the roles they play. \"Men are expected to be the primary financial provider which can be as restrictive as the homemaker role thrust on women,\" he says. John, who works for a NGO, says that being the stay-at-home dad made him realise how much harder a womans job is. \"There is a lot of glory and adulation attached to childcare when a man is doing it, which isnt necessary,\" he adds. But the decision doesnt go uncriticised. Sumankumar, who took time off from his regular job to write a book Ranga Half-Pants, often encountered the question, \"But, what do you actually do?\" every time he explained he was a stay-at-home dad. \"I was described as a house-husband as if it was a derogatory thing. But quitting my job helped me get rid of the worst addiction in the world — the pay cheque. I had to ask my wife for money. It is not easy for the male ego. I even needed counselling. But once I succeeded, it was the most liberating experience,\" he says. Shrivastava has given up hanging out with his male friends every Friday night. \"Now I can meet them only once a month, or even less often if Amrita is travelling. I do miss it but its not a big deal,\" he says. The compromise could be well worth it. In a 2017 study, researchers from Imperial College London, Kings College London and Oxford University found that babies whose fathers were more engaged and active in their initial months performed better in cognitive tests at age two. Professor Paul Ramchandani, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, who led the research, said: \"Even as early as three months, these father-child interactions can positively predict cognitive development almost two years later, so theres something probably quite meaningful for later development.\" But research in the field has not percolated down to practice just yet. Though global companies may have an empathetic approach to fathers who want to devote more time to home and family, at the end of the day the corner office is up for grabs only for those who are prepared to run the rat race. But John would rather sit in the bleachers. In the time he spent at home, he built a relationship with his daughter and counsels all men to do the same. \"I have learnt a lot of empathy and patience,\" he says. Sumankumar chimes in saying all men should take three to six months off to learn to appreciate their partner and their child. Professor Marian Baird, a work and family expert at Sydney University, in a report warns \"theres still a long way to go\" before businesses fully take on board the reality of the modern working father. Her research on employer attitudes to parental leave illustrates some of the constraints fathers face. Businesses are now quite amenable to mothers taking lengthy periods of parental leave and returning to work part-time but its a different story for dads. \"Employers have accepted that fathers should take some leave around the time of a birth, but its really a pretty short period — about two weeks,\" she said. A British study warns of an emerging \"fatherhood penalty\" as men choose to move into lower-paid and lower-quality work because they have become fathers. Nearly half the fathers surveyed for Britains recent \"Modern Family Index\" said they would prefer to trade in for a less stressful job, reflecting the difficulty they face in reconciling work and home. More than a third said they would take a pay-cut to strike a better balance between job and family. This desire was most pronounced among younger \"millennial generation\" fathers, many of whom have a partner working full-time. In India though, paternity leave is still considered a paid holiday. In March this year India passed the historic Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Bill 2016 that allowed women paid leave for 26 weeks — up from the previous 12 weeks — for pregnancy and childcare. Women rights activists and parliamentarians had called for the government to consider paternity leave so that men also do their bit in raising infants. In response, Union minister Maneka Gandhi reportedly said, \"Men in India do not utilise their existing leaves in order to take care of their child. If men gave me one iota of hope by taking sick leave for childcare, then yes, we can think of mooting a proposal for paternity leave.\" Though she was shouted down for her \"regressive views\", shes not far off the mark. In fact, while this reporter was searching for men who are very hands-on in raising their child, an exasperated wife asked us, \"Do such men even exist?\" They are evidently few and far between.','HOME-SELF-GOALS-A-BIGGER-THREAT-TO-BJP-THAN-OPPONENT-RAHUL','Himanshi Dhawan','2017-06-18 01:00:00','| TNN | Jun 18, 2017, 01:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:50'),(580,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/self-goals-a-bigger-threat-to-bjp-than-opponent-rahul/meet-the-big-b-of-maths/articleshow/59087852.cms','Meet the Big B of maths','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-59087894,width-400,resizemode-4/59087894.jpg]','R D Sharma isnt the kind of author youd bump into at lit fests. But his bestselling books have helped many CBSE students lose their dread of maths. Sunday Times profiles the tutor turned internet star He dreams of algorithms that would give most people nightmares. And, spends every waking hour thinking of ways to explain concepts like series solution of linear differential equations. Meet Dr Ravi Dutt Sharma — mathematics teacher and author of 25 reference books — whose name evokes as much awe as the subject he teaches. And though students have used his thick tomes for the last 31 years to ace the dreaded maths exam, its only recently that a spoof video turned the tutor into a YouTube star. The Viral Fever (TVF) video A day with R D Sharma stars an eccentric genius and his obsession with numbers. Sharma, in the video, prays to deity X, eats chapatis with a 5cm diameter made painstakingly with a compass, gives directions that involve using a protractor to find the right road and his mobile ringtone is the hit song from Madhuri-starrer Tezaab, Ek, do, teen. Indias preoccupation with maths and R D Sharma can be judged by the fact that the video has notched up 3.5 million views. Shown the video by his students, the real-life R D Sharma had a good laugh but said he shared little with his on-screen persona except for the love for maths. \"I like to spend all my time thinking and writing about maths problems. I find it relaxing,\" he says. When he is not writing books explaining mathematical concepts for classes 6 to 12 and engineering students, Sharma is busy dispensing his duty as vice-principal and head of department of science and humanities at Delhi governments Guru Nanak Dev Institute of Technology. The son of a poor Rajasthan farmer who walked 15km to school before his father finally saved up enough to buy him a cycle, Sharma says his love for the subject blossomed early. Lying on a charpoy under the stars, Sharma senior would make his son recite multiplication tables up to 40 before he could go to bed. By age 9, Sharma had not only mastered the tables but also knew the square roots and cube roots of numbers till 20. Not surprisingly, the boy would top his class in the tiny village of Bhoopkhera in Behror tehsil, over 150km from Delhi. Times were tough and Sharma recalls how his father borrowed money to pay for his graduation. He turned author by sheer accident. Sharma was doing his PhD from Rajasthan University when a senior teacher who taught linear algebra passed away. \"There was a vacuum because there was no standardised Indian textbook for the subject. The only book that could be used was by a foreign author and very expensive. I had scored 100% in the subject. So I stepped in to write my first book in 1986. It was not only adopted in the university but continued to be used for the next 10-11 years,\" he says. There was no looking back after that. Reluctant to part with sales figures, Dhanpat Rai Publications owner Ish Kapur claims that Sharmas books are best-selling in the class 9 to 12 segment. Last year 25 lakh students gave the CBSE board exam for classes 10 and 12 and its reasonable to assume that a significant number used Sharmas books. \"If I say that CBSE students from Kashmir to Kanyakumari use Dr Sharmas books, it would not be an exaggeration. We cover 10,000 schools in the country and our books go to West Asia and Singapore, even to the US,\" Kapur says. Chandan Kumar, who co-wrote the hit TVF video, recalls channelling his Patna school days when everyone was swotting from R D Sharma or R S Aggarwals books to bring the man to life. \"While discussing the script, we realised maths was a subject that inspires strong emotions. People either love or hate it, there is no indifference. So we wrote about a guy whose life revolves around maths,\" he says. One tortured soul posted how Sharma was way more strict than the video portrayal while many others acknowledged his contribution to their maths results. A student who prepared for his engineering entrance exams in 1999-2000 under Sharma recalls a test where the highest marks were just 25 out of 50. \"That was a jolt, and he humiliated us further by saying that he expected a lot more. I remember one of my fellow students saying to me, Yeh banda andar aag laga deta hai (this man motivates me).\" A joke this blogger used to crack goes like this: \"Let Sharma = X, then R.D. Sharma = R.D.X.\" Students may be mixed in their reactions but clearly there is no denying the popularity of Sharmas books. Mohammed Azam Khan who runs Azams Maths Classes in Lucknow describes the teachers influence with flair. \"People are fans of filmstars. For us, he is Amitabh Bachchan.\"','HOME-SELF-GOALS-A-BIGGER-THREAT-TO-BJP-THAN-OPPONENT-RAHUL','Himanshi Dhawan','2017-06-11 01:00:00','| TNN | Jun 11, 2017, 01:00 IST','2017-12-16 19:20:51'),(581,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/10-home-remedies-to-avoid-swine-flu/articleshow/4888598.cms','10 home remedies to avoid swine flu','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-46261694,width-400,resizemode-4/46261694.jpg]','Are the rising swine flu casualties giving you jitters? Not sure how you can avoid falling prey to the growing epidemic? First and foremost, there is absolutely no need to panic. Here are some easy steps you can take to tackle a flu virus of any kind, including swine flu. It is not necessary to follow all the steps at once. You can pick and choose a combination of remedies that suit you best. However, if you are already suffering from flu, these measures can help only up to an extent. 1. Have five duly washed leaves of Tulsi (known as Basil in English; medicinal name Ocimum sanctum) everyday in the morning. Tulsi has a large number of therapeutic properties. It keeps throat and lungs clear and helps in infections by way of strengthening your immunity. 2. Giloi (medicinal name Tinospora cordifolia) is a commonly available plant in many areas. Take a one-foot long branch of giloi, add five to six leaves of Tulsi and boil in water for 15-20 minutes or long enough to allow the water to extract its properties. Add black pepper and sendha (salt used during religious fasts), rock or black salt, or Misri (crystalised sugar like lumps to make it sweet) according to taste. Let it cool a bit and drink this kadha (concoction) while still warm. It will work wonders for your immunity. If giloi plant is not available, get processed giloi powder from Hamdard or others, and concoct a similar drink once a day. 3. A small piece of camphor (kapoor) approximately the size of a tablet should be taken once or twice a month. It can be swallowed with water by adults while children can take it along with mashed potatoes or banana because they will find it difficult to have it without any aides. Please remember camphor is not to be taken everyday, but only once each season, or once a month. 4. Those who can take garlic, must have two pods of raw garlic first thing in the morning. To be swallowed daily with lukewarm water. Garlic too strengthens immunity like the earlier measures mentioned. 5. Those not allergic to milk, must take a glass of hot or lukewarm milk every night with a small measure of haldi (turmeric). 6. Aloe vera (gwarpatha) too is a commonly available plant. Its thick and long, cactus-like leaves have an odourless gel. A teaspoon gel taken with water daily can work wonders for not only your skin and joint pains, but also boost immunity. 7. Take homeopathic medicines — Pyrogenium 200 and Inflenzium 200 in particular — five tablets three times a day, or two-three drops three times a day. While these are not specifically targeted at H1N1 either, these work well as preventive against common flu virus. 8. Do Pranayam daily (preferably under guidance if you are already not initiated into it) and go for morning jog/walk regularly to keep your throat and lungs in good condition and body in fine fettle. Even in small measures, it will work wonders for your bodys resistance against all such diseases which attack the nose, throat and lungs, besides keeping you fit. 9. Have citrus fruits, particularly Vitamin C rich Amla (Indian gooseberry) juice. Since fresh Amla is not yet available in the market (not for another three to four months), it is not a bad idea to buy packaged Amla juice which is commonly available nowadays. 10. Last but not the least, wash your hands frequently every day with soap and warm water for 15-20 seconds; especially before meals, or each time after touching a surface that you suspect could be contaminated with flu virus such as a door handle or a knob/handle, especially if you have returned from a public place or used public transport. Alcohol-based hand cleaners should be kept handy at all times and used until you can get soap and warm water.

Fuelling the alarming trend is the rise in diabetes prevalence in rural areas. The unexpected surge has forced the Diabetes Atlas, a global report on the disorder, to plan a revision of the India-specific numbers in October. A recent study we did in Chennai and Kancheepuram shows an increase in prevalence of 40% in urban areas in six years, and 49% in rural areas in three years. This proves the general hypothesis of diabetes affecting more urbanites than rural people wrong, says Indian Diabetes Research Foundation president Dr A Ramachandran. According to Diabetes Atlas published in 2007, there are 246 million diabetics across the world, with 80% of them in the developing and underdeveloped countries. India, according to these statistics, has 40.9 million diabetics, closely followed by China with 39.8 million diabetics. It was predicted that by 2025, India will have 69.9 million people and China will have 59.3 million people with diabetics. When the atlas was released, the hypothesis was that the prevalence in cities was higher than in rural areas. Now it looks like there is a change. We need to see how many states in India show the same trend. That will help us revise the policies and strategies to battle diabetes, says Ramachandran, who is to be part of the committee working out the revised data. The shift, according to Endocrine Diagnostic Centre and Diabetes Care Centre medical director Dr S Murthy, is possibly because of the urbanisation of rural areas. Changing lifestyles and gentic factors lead to metabolic disorders, he says. Dr V Mohan, who heads the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, says the country is now at a crossroads and the gap between urban-rural incidence of the disorder is decreasing. It happens differently in different places. In Kerala, the incidence is already higher in rural areas, he says. Dr Anoop Misra, who heads the department of diabetology at Fortis Hospital in Delhi says a country-wide study is required before revision. No formula evolved to extrapolate a region-specific study will be error-free.

Their first stop would be Agra, from there they would go to Varanasi, and then, perhaps, head west to Goa. But on foggy Thursday morning, they had barely crossed Noida and got on to the Yamuna Expressway when a bus crushed one of them, 26-year-old Mathew Antony Ridley, the computer programmer, against a massive signboard pole. His two friends, Bennett Joel Kowald (27), the graphic designer, and Ian Thomas Borg (26), the architect, were lucky to survive. This happened around 8 in the morning near Jaypee Sports City in Dankaur. A UP roadways bus first hit a slow-moving truck, and then tried to get away, crushing Mathew, who got sandwiched between the bus and a signboard pole. Police said visibility was poor because of the fog and the bus driver had not spotted the truck. Mathews GoPro camera on the hired Bullet may have recorded the whole horror story. Ian said Mathew was riding ahead and he and Bennett were following him, sticking to the left lane on the Yamuna Expressway. The bus, he said, was speeding. Police said the bus - with some 40 passengers, going from Pari Chowk to Aligarh - first hit the truck and then the driver lost control. \"The driver took a sharp left turn to escape and rammed against Mathews bike.

Young college goers who get fixed daily allowances from their parents — and particularly those who have to travel long distances — are now having to pay twice as much as they paid for their rides a few months ago. DMRC revised its rates twice this year, in May and again in October. \"It is injustice to students,\" said Rohit Singh, a resident of Sector 56 in Gurgaon who studies at Amity University in Noida. He commutes daily, first by Rapid Metro and then switching to Delhi Metro at Sikanderpur. \"I board at Rapid Metro Sector 56 station and disembark at Botanical Garden in Noida,\" he said. The one-way trip costs Rs 80. Thats a commuting bill of Rs 3,200 a month just for Metro (20 days, 5-day week). \"The rates are quite exorbitant and I wish they slash it for students at least,\" Singh said. He proposed exclusive metro cards for students. Mohit Yadav, also a Gurgaon resident, who studies in the same college, said DMRC needed to show flexibility. \"DMRC is fully entitled to make a profit. But they should spare us and take our interests into consideration,\" he said. \"The hike must be rolled back,\" said Ishani Verma, a student living in DLF-2 who studies at Lady Shri Ram College in Delhi. Verma said she shells out nearly Rs 80 per day as Metro fare which, for her, is \"not a problem\". \"But all my friends and I agree that fares must be relaxed,\" she said. Some students said they were cutting down on food and stationery expenses as the bulk of their pocket money is being spent on Metro fares. Kavya Chandrika, who lives in Noidas Sector 50 and is a first-year student of LSR, has to pay Rs 100 towards Metro fares every day. She boards from Noida City Centre and gets off at Moolchand. \"Before the fare hike, I had the luxury to spend on food but now, I think twice. I know the financial constraints on a middle-class family and my house is no different. As a result, I cannot muster the courage to ask my parents to increase my pocket money,\" she said. Kanchan Lohia, who is studying law in Delhi University, commutes to her college from Noida daily. \"The Metro fare hike has definitely put an extra burden on us. On the surface, it looks like it is a hike of only a few rupees but when you take into account that one has to commute on a daily basis, you realise the hike is really pinching,\" said Lohia, whose destination is Vishwavidyalaya Metro station (Rs 100, round trip). \"Instead of asking my parents to increase my pocket money, I have cut down on my expenses,\" she added. Indirapuram resident Sakshi Nirmal, who is pursuing chartered accountancy, commutes to Laxmi Nagar, where she is taking coaching classes (Rs 60, round trip from Vaishali). She said, \"The Metro fare hike has put an extra burden and it is really hurting. Earlier, we could buy other things, even without asking our parents, with money we saved from our daily allowance.\" Another Indirapuram resident, Akriti Sahni, who studies in Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University, Saket, said, \"Earlier, for the one-way Metro trip, I had to shell out Rs 36 per day but now it has gone up to Rs 50 (one way, from Vaishali).

Gopendra Singh Parmar, an LIC agent based in Rajasthans Dhaulpur district, alleged that he had to cough up Rs 15.88 lakh for his sons treatment at Medanta hospital. Seven-year-old Saurya Pratap, according to Parmar, was diagnosed with dengue at a hospital in Dhaulpur on October 28. As his condition didnt improve, the family took him to another hospital in Dhaulpur. \"However, when his condition deteriorated further, he was in Dhaulpur. He was suffering from severe dengue with multiple organ dysfunction. Saurya underwent treatment at Medanta hospital for 22 days,\" Parmar told TOI. The child later died in Delhis Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital. Parmar claimed that he borrowed money from his relatives and even mortgaged his property to pay the hefty treatment cost demanded by the Gurgaon hospital. \"As an LIC agent, I do not earn more than Rs 500 a day. You can imagine how we had struggled to arrange the money,\" said Parmar. He further said the family decided to shift Saurya to RML hospital on November 20 since there was no improvement in his condition, and the bill was running high. Saurya was critical at the time of admission to RML, and died on November 22, two days after being admitted to the Delhi hospital. On Friday, Parmar filed a police complaint at Gurgaons Sadar police station against the hospital management, chairman of department of pediatrics Dr Sunit Singhi, Dr Maninder Dhaliwal, Dr Veena Raghunathan and other supporting members of their team. The family accused the hospital authorities of \"murder, forgery, cheating and extortion\".

Additional Sessions Judge Jasbir Singh Kundu fixed the matter for January 6 for arguments on the appeal filed by the accused against an order of the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) denying him bail. The probe agency opposed the appeal in a written submission before the court. The court posted the matter for the next date after an adjournment was sought by the counsel for the accused. The JJB had on December 20 held that the 16-year-old boy would be tried as an adult and directed that he be produced before the Gurgaon sessions court today. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 lowers the age of juveniles from 18 years to 16 years for heinous crimes like rape, murder and dacoity-cum- murder, which warrant at least seven years of imprisonment. However, the JJB first decides whether the crime committed has been \"child-like\" or was it committed in an \"adult frame of mind\", following which the JJB orders the accused to be tried as juvenile or adult. The JJB had passed the order on a plea that the accused teenager should not be treated as a juvenile. If convicted, he will stay in a correctional home till he is 21-years old after which the court can shift him to a jail or grant him bail, it had said. The board had earlier rejected the bail plea of the Class 11 Ryan International School student, charged with killing Pradhuman Thakur, a Class 2 student of the same school, in the school premises on September 8. It had set up a committee which included a psychologist from the PGI, Rohtak for an expert opinion on the accused, who had been taken into custody by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) last month.

One of his accomplices has been arrested while another managed to flee, police said. The deceased has been identified as Akash, a resident of Bahadurgarh. \"Akash was a seasoned criminal, wanted in 25 to 30 cases of thefts and snatchings. He was arrested by Gurgaon police earlier also,\" said DCP Sumit Kumar. \"His accomplices also have criminal records. Sagar, the one who has been nabbed, spent some time in Jhajjar jail.\" A mandatory magisterial probe has, however, been ordered into the encounter after the emergence of a purported CCTV footage of the shootout, which contradicts the polices story to some extent. Police said it all started when a crime unit team of Sector 40 had gone out in search of a grey colour Honda City that was stolen from a persons house in Shivaji Nagar on Wednesday night. The car owner, Vivek Sachdeva, informed cops that he had spotted the vehicle, using its GPS location, to Ravi Nagar area on Thursday night and accompanied the cops to the area. When the police team reached the spot, assistant sub-inspector Rajesh knocked on the driver side window of the car. \"One seated next to the driver suddenly whipped out a gun and fired a shot. Rajesh had a narrow escape as the bullet missed him,\" according to an FIR filed against the trio under Section 307 (attempt to murder) and the Arms Act. ASI Rajesh retaliated and fired back from his service pistol. Soon the driver (Akash) tried to speed away but it hit a Santro and then an elevated manhole, until it finally crashed into an electric police and came to a halt, police said. While Manish who had opened fire managed to flee, Sagar was arrested and an injured Akash was rushed to General hospital in Civil Lines, where he was declared brought dead. A post-mortem was conducted on Akash on Friday and, according to sources, he died of bullet wound. A probe has been instituted under judicial magistrate Ashish Arya, after the CCTV footage from a building near the encounter site purportedly shows an unarmed man running away.

He loves to take songs on a voyage, and on the night, the poems of Kabir switched musical territory, segueing spiritedly from robust Haryanvi to full-on rock and back. \"Its not that I sang just bhajans - I mixed some folk into my repertoire, some Western, some Punjabi, some Haryanvi folk, and then Hindi and Bollywood songs.\" For Phogat, artistes should reflect the society they come from. \"When I am standing on the stage, in front of hundreds of people, it is my responsibility to convey a message that is in their hearts, that they will understand.\" So Phogat spoke on the lot of the average Indian farmer, the stresses of city dwellers, the growing chasm between rich and poor, and the many partitions tearing India apart. \"Politicians will fight over religion, that is their job, but why are you, the common people, fighting?\" Politicians, he warned, are ready to break up the nation, but we shouldnt play their game. \"Because then harm will befall all .\" There are days, Phogat confessed, when he no longer feels like singing, not when folks are turning on each other with such blind hatred. Still, the way he engaged with and embraced the crowd, it was obvious there was nowhere else hed rather be. For as Phogat said, tradition is like a river. \"It will cut its way through mountains, and chart its own path, but it keeps on flowing.\" Good times or bad, music will always nourish souls. Phogat made sure all went home sated.','CITY-GURGAON','Sharad Kohli','2017-12-23 02:51:00','| TNN | Dec 23, 2017, 02:51 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(626,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/special-cops-helpline-to-ensure-women-safety-cm/articleshow/62200963.cms','Special cops, helpline to ensure women safety: CM','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62201481,width-400,resizemode-4/62201481.jpg]','GURUGRAM: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday said besides deploying special women police officers, the helpline number — 1091 — would be made centralised in a bid to ensure safety of women across the state.

He said a major chunk has been spent towards building and road repair, that is Rs 200 crore. In the beginning of this year, MCG signed a contract for the repair of roads across the city and civic officials said around 60% of the road repair work has already been done and all the roads in the city will be repaired latest by March 2018.

Daljeet Singh Juttla from west London had been stopped by Scotland Yard officers with 90,000 pounds of drugs money couriered by one of the other gang members. Yesterday, Liverpool Crown Court handed the 42-year-old Juttla a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, and 200 hours of unpaid work for the money laundering charge. \"Established trafficking routes like these present a complex and troubling threat to the UK. With well worked-out logistics a criminal group can turn its hand to anything from gun running or drug smuggling, expanding their own operations or hiring out their services to others,\" said Jane Lloyd, branch commander at the UKs National Crime Agency (NCA), which conducted the UK-wide investigation. \"The NCA officers are alert to the tactics criminals use to shift commodities and hide their activity and are equipped with the skills and tools needed to bring them to justice,\" she said. The officers exposed the gang in an investigation that ran from October 2014 to January 2016. Officers from the Metropolitan, Greater Manchester, Cheshire and Merseyside police provided support to the long- running operation. The group was led by Jamie Hughes and operated out of the north west of England. Members delivered bulk loads of drugs to clients in locations from Scotland to London in vans with hidden compartments. Hughes was imprisoned for five years and four months after pleading guilty to his role in the conspiracy. Hughes, who kept a stun gun disguised as an iPhone, installed a CCTV system to monitor his driveway. This provided NCA officers with key evidence against his network as footage showed various members of the conspiracy exchanging packages or leaving Hughess address with parcels. In addition to cash seizures and damning emails, evidence used against the group included traces of ketamine found in the floor concealment of a white Peugeot Partner van and a hidden compartment in the rear of a white Vauxhall Vivaro van. Both concealments were skilfully constructed and operated by switches in the cabs, the NCA revealed.','NRI-OTHER-NEWS','','2017-12-21 17:47:00','PTI | Dec 21, 2017, 17:47 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(631,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/other-news/india-tops-list-of-migrants-living-abroad-at-17-million-un/articleshow/62131982.cms','India tops list of migrants living abroad at 17 million: UN','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62132004,width-400,resizemode-4/62132004.jpg]','UNITED NATIONS: India has topped the list of people living abroad at 17 million with about 5 million Indians residing in the Gulf region alone, according to a new UN report.

In 2017, India was the largest country of origin of international migrants at 17 million, followed by Mexico at 13 million. Other countries of origin with large migrant populations include the Russia at 11 million, China at 10 million, Bangladesh at 7 million, Syria at 7 million and Pakistan and Ukraine at 6 million each. The number of migrants from India now reside in multiple destination countries, including the UAE at 3 million, the US and Saudi Arabia at 2 million each, the report said. There are now an estimated 258 million people living in a country other than their country of birth -- an increase of 49 per cent since 2000, it added. International migration is a critical concern for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the report said. \"Reliable data and evidence are critical to combat misperceptions about migration and to inform migration policies,\" said Liu Zhenmin, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairss Under-Secretary-General. \"These new estimates of numbers of international migrants around the world will provide an important baseline for Member States as they begin their negotiations on the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration,\" Liu said. The report shows that international migration makes an important contribution to population growth in many parts of the world and even reverses population decline in some countries or areas. Between 2000 and 2015, migration contributed 42 per cent of the population growth in Northern America and 31 per cent in Oceania.

The deal between Liberty House and NRI steel magnate Lakshmi N Mittals US steelworks, which includes a 540,000- tonne a year electric arc furnace and 680,000-tonne a year rod mill, had been agreed earlier this year. The sale marks the first in a series of strategic North American acquisitions and new projects targeted by Gupta-led GFG Alliance. The 600,000-square-foot plant, serving the construction and automotive markets, is set to re-start melting and rolling next year as the first step in GFGs investment plans for the American steel industry. \"Securing the Georgetown furnace and mill is a major milestone for us, marking our first major step in the USA. The melting and rolling facilities here give us a formidable entry to the American market and provide a strong platform for expansion,\" GFG Alliance and Liberty House chief Gupta said in a statement on Monday. The steel tycoon said he wanted to apply his GreenSteel sustainable strategy to the American plants, in line with the UK and Australia. \"Weve already had customers contacting us about placing orders, so were keen to get back up and running as quickly as possible,\" he said. Liberty will initially re-hire 125 former employees at Georgetown and then build the workforce to 250 in the medium- term. The group is targeting a major share of the US market for home-produced wire rod, demand for which is projected to grow substantially during 2018. Completion of the Georgetown deal follows successful negotiations between Liberty and several key stakeholders, including the United Steelworkers of America union, Georgetown Council and the South Carolina State Government over the past few months. The steelworks were a pivotal part of the American states industrial infrastructure for nearly 70 years until it was shuttered in 2015. Liberty has said it wants to restore it to its former position of prominence and bring hundreds of skilled jobs back to the plant and to the local and state economy. \"Throughout the process, ArcelorMittal has been steadfast in our goal of maintaining the Georgetown steelmaking operation to preserve jobs and maximise the value of the property for our shareholders,\" said John Brett, president and CEO of ArcelorMittal USA. \"While bittersweet for ArcelorMittal, we are hopeful that todays announcement is a celebration for Liberty and GFG Alliance, the United Steelworkers and the Georgetown community,\" Brett said. Under an agreement with the United Steelworkers, the company expects key roles on the furnace, casters and rolling mill to be filled by experienced former employees of the plant and it is also in discussion with Georgetown Council about training programmes to prepare a new generation of workers for the industry. Liberty House is part of the wider GFG Alliance, a global group of energy, mining, metals, engineering and financial services businesses, headquartered in London. It has additional hubs in Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney with presence in around 30 countries worldwide.

The banking sector has been reeling under $156 billion of stressed loans that is widely seen as delaying the credit growth needed to revive private investment. Most of the bad debt is held by state-run lenders, which are suffering after years of bad lending decisions. In its report, the IMF welcomed the governments plan to inject about $32 billion to recapitalise state-run lenders, which was announced in October, as an important step to \"support effective resolution of nonperforming assets\". But the organisation said the injection needed to be accompanied by steps to restructure state-run banks, as well as action to improve corporate governance, and a reduction of the governments stakes in the lenders. The IMFs financial stability report also recommended India undertake \"a cautious reduction\" in the minimum amount of investment in government securities that banks are required to hold, in what is known as the statutory liquidity ratio. Undertaking these steps \"would boost the systems capacity to support credit to the economy, while reducing moral hazard and contingent fiscal liabilities\", the IMF said in the report. When announcing its $32 billion recapitalisation plan, the government had pledged to announce a series of reforms of the state-run lenders, though it has yet to disclose details. The IMF also called for greater independence and more supervisory powers by law for the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, to supervise and regulate state-run lenders. Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has also called on the government to undertake reforms at the state-run lenders, saying doing so was necessary to avoid repeating the bad lending decisions that have led to the current woes in the sector.','BUSINESS-INDIA-BUSINESS','','2017-12-21 20:35:00','Reuters | Dec 21, 2017, 20:35 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(634,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/christmas-cheer-markets-close-at-record-high/articleshow/62208246.cms','Christmas cheer!

On Friday, the finance ministry told the Lok Sabha that NPAs, or bad debt, went up from Rs 3,536 crore at the end of March 2015 to Rs 5,192 crore on March 31, 2017. The surge took place in 2015-16, with the pace slowing down during the last financial year. The problem is so acute for at least five lenders that the stock of bad loans has more than doubled, with UCO Bank and Indian Bank leading the pack. At the same time, the increase in loan flow has also been less than 10% during this two-year period. Absence of guarantees makes it easy to default But what is even worse is that there was only 3.4% rise during 2016-17, on the back of a 5.6% growth in the previous year, indicating that either demand was tepid or banks were reluctant to lend. Bankers, however, said that they had not gone slow on education loans. They said that defaults were rising as several students had not found good jobs, especially when it came to those who pursued MBAs or engineering degrees. However, there are cases where even students from good colleges who were employed by leading companies are refusing to pay. For instance, an engineer with a global technology giant stop repaying the loan and was tracked down through social media. When confronted, he cleared the dues, said a bank executive. \"The problem is the absence of security and guarantees, which makes it easy to default,\" he added. The government told Parliament that to reduce the incidence of NPA in education loans, the IBA Model Education Loan Scheme has been modified to factor in the the needs of students. The changes include a repayment holiday or a moratorium of course period plus one year, additional moratorium to account for spells of under-employment or unemployment, and extension of the repayment period to 15 years to reduce the equated monthly instalment. The Centre has also launched a Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for Education Loans (CGFEL) for loans upto Rs 7.5 lakh to provide guarantee up to 75% of the default amount.','BUSINESS-INDIA-BUSINESS','','2017-12-23 01:01:00','TNN | Dec 23, 2017, 01:01 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(637,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/up-cm-seeks-investment-in-defence-aerospace/articleshow/62214822.cms','UP CM seeks investment in defence, aerospace','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62216272,width-400,resizemode-4/62216272.jpg]','Mumbai: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday made a strong pitch for investments in aerospace and defence in the northern state of the country as he makes efforts to adopt a zero-crime tolerance policy, which would help in bringing investments. Adityanath, who was in the city for a day, said that UP holds significant potential for industrial development and the government is making efforts to foster inclusive and sustainable growth. He was speaking at the Uttar Pradesh investors summit organised by the state and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). The CM emphasised that his government has been working to create a business friendly environment in the state. In July, UP put in place a revamped industrial investment and employment policy to create jobs and boost the exchequers revenues. As far as attracting investments goes, UP doesnt get much capital from companies like its peers Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. This is because, among other factors, the northern state is considered notorious as far as law & order is concerned. This has started to change. The CM said that the state is moving towards a zero-crime tolerance policy, something which would aid investments.

Airtel, the Indias largest telecom company with 282 million subscribers, got the temporary reprieve with conditions after Rs 138 crore Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) was repaid into 55.63 lakh original accounts of its customers, sources privy to the development told PTI. The second interim order to this effect has been passed by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) keeping in view convenience of customers and also the looming March 31 deadline given by the Supreme Court for mobile SIM re-verification. The authority will take a view on the issue after it receives a report from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Telecom Department on January 10. The UIDAI has asked both the RBI and the telecom department to conduct an audit of systems, processes, applications, documentations followed by Bharti Airtel \"to ensure that the company is in compliance with their license conditions\". \"UIDAI has not allowed Airtel Payment Bank Limited to use eKYC license key and it shall remain deactivated until further notice,\" the source said citing the latest order. As per the conditions imposed on Airtel, the company would have sent messages to its customers within 24 hours that their DBT accounts have been reverted to the originally designated bank account. Airtel will also inform its customers in the next 24 hours that the direct benefit transfers received in their Airtel payment bank accounts have been duly reversed to original bank accounts. As per another rider, Airtel can use the e-KYC and authentication service only for re-verification and issuance of SIM cards. It will not be allowed to leverage the same for obtaining consent of the Aadhaar holder for opening bank accounts, wallet, DTH or any other goods or services, the source added. Both Airtel and Airtel Payments bank came under fire after the the Sunil Mittal-led firm allegedly opened accounts of its mobile phone subscribers without seeking their \"informed consent\", and LPG subsidy worth crores was deposited into these accounts. The government acted swiftly in the matter and UIDAI, in a strong move late last week, temporarily barred the company from conducting Aadhaar-based SIM verification of mobile customers using eKYC process, and e-KYC of payments bank clients.','BUSINESS-INDIA-BUSINESS','','2017-12-21 20:00:00','PTI | Dec 21, 2017, 20:00 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(639,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-wants-to-know-the-selling-price-of-twitter/articleshow/62209574.cms','Elon Musk wants to know the selling price of Twitter','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62209616,width-400,resizemode-4/62209616.jpg]','NEW DELHI: Elon Musk needs no introduction.

The buyback had been a long-standing demand by some of the founders and high-profile former executives, who have been pushing Infosys to return surplus capital to shareholders.

Since agrarian crisis will be one of the key issues in the run up to the assembly polls in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan next year and the general election in 2019, the upcoming budget will provide the government an opportunity to announce its intent. \"We had a good crop year in 2016-17, but farmers had to face problem in getting remunerative prices of their produce. This is something which we need to address and the budget is likely to focus on this aspect\", said a senior official who has been part of a team to extend agriculture ministrys input for budget to the finance ministry. The Centre has already taken several measures to address the issue but will now attempt to strengthen it by taking actions like devising more systematic procurement method and expanding the network of e-NAM (e-National Agriculture Market) from 585 in 2018 to over 1,000 by 2020. The idea will be to bring more and more regulated market on e-NAM platform so that the farmers can get better price of their produce without being exploited by commission agents and cartel of traders. \"The NITI Aayog and the Prime Ministers economic advisory council too are working on it. Though agriculture is the subject where the states have to be on board for success of many schemes, the governments focus in the budget is likely to be on allocating more fund for centrally-sponsored schemes\", said the official. The funds for expanding e-NAMs footprints, cold chain, irrigation infrastructure, micro-irrigation and crop insurance scheme are expected to be increased. \"Farmers need input subsidies and minimum support price (MSP) for their produce, but these two alone cannot solve the problem\", said the official while emphasising on the need to create robust market mechanisms for farm produce so that farmers dont face a crisis in a good crop year like what the rural Gujarat faced. The crop year 2016-17 (July-June) had seen record foodgrain production of 275.68 million tonnes. Besides, more farmers came under the network of the new crop insurance. Number of farmers, benefiting from crop insurance also increased in 2016-17 as compared to 2015-16. All these, however, do not seem to have addressed the problems. Horticulture production also reached record levels, but did not prove to be a boon for farmers. There have been report of distress selling from many states. \"These are the worrying signs. Loss due to disaster can be tackled through insurance. But the problem of plenty (bumper production) can only be tackled through robust market system, cold chain and effective procurement mechanism. The 2017-18 budget is likely to address these issues\", said the official. Farmers in Saurashtra-Kutch region, where the BJPs tally went down as compared to 2012, saw prices of cotton and groundnut produce slide. Though the Centre had increased MSP and the state had extended bonus on it, poor procurement had forced farmers to go for distress sales in open markets that fetched them much lower price than the MSP.','BUSINESS-INDIA-BUSINESS','Vishwa Mohan','2017-12-23 12:45:00','| TNN | Dec 23, 2017, 12:45 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(642,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/markets-open-on-cautious-yet-positive-note/articleshow/62203075.cms','Markets surge in mid-day trade to hit fresh all-time high','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62203316,width-400,resizemode-4/62203316.jpg]','NEW DELHI: Fridays early equity trading saw the benchmark indices open on a positive footing though they were not gaining heavily.

But some recent research suggests that this may not actually be the case. In many ways, money does not necessarily buy you happiness,\" said Paul Piff, from the University of California in the US. For the study published in the journal Emotion, the researchers used a survey of a nationally representative sample of 1,519 people. The participants were asked about their household income and answered a series of questions designed to measure their tendency to experience seven distinct emotions that are considered to make up the core of happiness: amusement, awe, compassion, contentment, enthusiasm, love and pride. For example, to measure compassion, the participants rated their agreement with various statements, including, \"Nurturing others gives me a warm feeling inside.\" The participants at the higher end of the socio-economic spectrum reported a greater tendency to experience emotions that focused on themselves, specifically, contentment and pride (as well as amusement). Individuals at the lower end of the income scale were more likely to experience emotions that focus on other people, namely compassion and love. Poorer individuals also reported experiencing more awe and beauty in the world around them. There was no apparent difference for enthusiasm, according to the researchers. \"These findings indicate that wealth is not unequivocally associated with happiness,\" said Piff. \"What seems to be the case is that your wealth predisposes you to different kinds of happiness,\" he said. \"While wealthier individuals may find greater positivity in their accomplishments, status and individual achievements, less wealthy individuals seem to find more positivity and happiness in their relationships, their ability to care for and connect with others,\" said Piff. He believes these differences may stem from higher-income individuals desire for independence and self-sufficiency, while the other-oriented emotions help lower-income individuals to form more interdependent bonds with others.','BUSINESS-INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS','','2017-12-23 16:17:00','PTI | Dec 23, 2017, 16:17 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(644,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/air-deccan-takes-wings-again-flies-to-jalgaon/articleshow/62220166.cms','Air Deccan takes wings again, flies to Jalgaon','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62220152,width-400,resizemode-4/62220152.jpg]','MUMBAI: Indias first low-cost carrier Air Deccan, which ceased operations after being acquired by erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines in 2008, took off wings again as a commuter airline with its maiden flight taking off for Jalgaon from here today.

The S Tel later enhanced its offer to Rs 13,752 crore over a period of 10 years for allotment of 6.2 MHz 2G spectrum. It even proposed to raise its bid to counter any competition. However, S Tel lost the race despite the fact that it went up to the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the government to grant licences on a competitive basis. Debunking the zero loss theory propounded by some Congress leaders again, an official of the comptroller and auditor general said if the S Tel offer was used as an indicator price band, the 122 new 2G licences would have fetched over Rs 65,900 crore. The federal auditor, in its 2010 report on the 2G spectrum allocations, had given a range of price bands it had used to indicate the presumptive losses on allocation of the licences on first-come first-serve basis. The auditors calculation of a loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crore was based on the auction price of 3G spectrum recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The 2G services then were actually offering 2.75G services, one of the reasons the auditor had compared it to 3G auction price. \"If price is calculated at 3G rates... the value works out to Rs 1,11,512 crore against Rs 9,014 crore realised by the government,\" the auditor had noted. Combined with the price discovery for the dual technology and beyond contracted quantity of 6.2 MHz, the total price fetched could have been in excess of Rs 1.76 lakh crore. Surprisingly, in defence of denying the S Tel offer, the department of telecom had argued that the S Tel had withdrawn its offer in the Supreme Court \"hence there was no loss to the government\". In fact, the S Tel had withdrawn its case from the apex court in March 2010, two years after the government had allocated all 2G licences. Based on the sale of equity by Unitech and Swan, the auditor had calculated the total value of the 122 licenses and 35 dual technology approvals issued in 2008 \"ranging from Rs 58,000 crore to Rs 68,000 crore against the actual revenues of Rs 12,386 crore earned\" by the government.','INDIA','Pradeep Thakur','2017-12-23 11:01:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 11:01 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(648,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bitcoin-goes-on-wild-ride-and-it-may-only-get-crazier/articleshow/62218565.cms','Bitcoin goes on wild ride and it may only get crazier','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62218558,width-400,resizemode-4/62218558.jpg?imglength=29089]','NEW YORK: Whats a bitcoin worth?

Litecoin founder Charlie Lee on Wednesday announced that he has \"sold and donated\" all his LTC (litecoins). \"I think investors should approach it with caution and I think many people will dive into it not understanding what it is,\" he said. As bitcoin skyrocketed this month, the volume of trading was unprecedented as investors hoping to catch a ride up piled in. Prices have risen so fast, the Friday returned the price of bitcoin only to where it was trading two weeks ago. The volatility has created a circus-like atmosphere. Some companies that have added the word \"bitcoin\" or related terms to their names to get in on the action. The craziest thing is, its worked. How a South Korean bitcoin exchange proved RBI right on the cryptocurrency Long Island Iced Tea Corp. until this week had been known for its peach-, raspberry-, guava-, lemon- and mango-flavored drinks. Then, on Thursday, the company announced a radical rebranding. Its changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp., shifting its primary focus from iced tea to \"the exploration of and investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.\" Blockchain is a ledger where transactions of digital currencies, like bitcoin, are recorded. Shares in Long Island Iced Tea soared 200 percent in one day. The Hicksville, New York, company did what investors are doing, hitching a ride on a currency that raced from less than $10,000 at the end of November to almost $20,000 on Sunday. And it cost less than $1,000 at the beginning of the year. RBI rings alarm bells on bitcoins, cautions investors The rise of price of bitcoin, which is still difficult to use if you actually want to buy something, has led to heated speculation about when the bubble might burst. The currency has been, if nothing else, highly elastic, bouncing back every time it crashes, which occurs about once every quarter. It fell 11.5 percent over two days in early December and 21.5 percent over five days in November. Curiosity has now driven bitcoin to the futures market, where investors bet on which direction it will go. Bitcoin futures started trading on two major exchanges - the Cboe and CME - this month. Those futures fell about 8 percent Friday. Bitcoin trading in India? Why its still a big no-no If people get burned, it wont be because they were not warned. The Securities and Exchange Commission put out a statement last week warning investors to be careful with bitcoin and other digital currencies. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission has proposed regulating bitcoin like a commodity, similar to gold or oil. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a financial watchdog, issued a similar warning recently.','BUSINESS-INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS','','2017-12-23 16:32:00','AP | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 16:32 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(649,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bad-loans-will-rise-to-11-1-from-10-2-in-a-year-rbi/articleshow/62200826.cms','Bad loans will rise to 11.1% from 10.2% in a year: RBI','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62203604,width-400,resizemode-4/62203604.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/62200825/Master.jpg]','MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that gross bad loans of banks are likely to rise to 11.1 per cent by September 2018 from 10.2 per cent as of September 2017. However, on the positive side, tests show that the degree of interconnectedness in the banking system has decreased gradually since 2012. \"The overall risks to the banking sector remained elevated due to asset quality concerns. Between March and September 2017, the gross non-performing advances (GNPAs) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) increased from 9.6 per cent to 10.2 per cent and the stressed advances ratio marginally increased from 12.1 per cent to 12.2 per cent,\" the RBI said in its financial stability report (FSR) released on Thursday. \"The macro stress test for credit risk indicates that under the baseline macro scenario, the gross non-performing assets may increase to 10.8 per cent by March 2018 and further to 11.1 per cent by September 2018,\" the report said. Among other risks to Indian banks, the report has flagged financial technology companies and cryptocurrencies as a potential risk. \"In particular, greater acceptance of cryptocurrencies is becoming a formidable risk to the traditional banking system,\" the report said. On online risks, the RBI said that the policy push towards digitisation of the financial system hinges crucially on a robust cyber-security framework. The RBI said that it has set up an inter-disciplinary standing committee to review the threats inherent in the existing/emerging technology on an ongoing basis. Despite the concerns thrown up by stress tests, the RBI is optimistic on the growth front. \"Domestically, the economy appears to have rebounded after the initial hiccups associated with the rollout of nationwide goods and services tax (GST), coming on the back of demonetisation. While the ongoing de-leveraging in the heavily indebted parts of the corporate sector and muted credit growth in the public sector banks pose a risk to growth, the decisive recapitalisation move by the government could provide the much needed fillip to private investment going forward,\" deputy governor N S Vishwanathan said in a foreword to the report. In a separate report on The Trends and Progress of Banking in India, the RBI said that the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017 introduced in Lok Sabha will address the moral hazard problem associated with various forms of government guarantees. The moral hazard refers to lenders with poor track record being able to raise funds at same rates as the best banks on the back of a government guarantee. According to the RBI, the new bill provides speedy and efficient resolution of distress for certain categories of financial service providers and recommends establishment of a Resolution Corporation (RC) for protection of consumers of specified service providers and of public funds.','BUSINESS-INDIA-BUSINESS','','2017-12-22 11:08:00','TNN | Updated: Dec 22, 2017, 11:08 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(650,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-govt-allows-companies-to-paste-mrp-stickers-till-march-next-year/articleshow/62219824.cms','GST: Govt allows companies to paste MRP stickers till March next year','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62219824,width-400,resizemode-4/62219824.jpg]','NEW DELHI: The government has allowed companies, till March 2018, to paste price stickers on unsold packaged products to reflect new MRP post GST, Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said on Saturday.

When rates of about 200 items were cut in mid-November, the ministry permitted to paste additional stickers under the the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011. \"In case of GST, we allowed companies to paste stickers on unsold packaged products till December.

As many as 178 items of daily use have been shifted from the top tax bracket of 28 per cent to 18 per cent, while a uniform 5 per cent tax was prescribed for all restaurants, both air- conditioned and non-AC.

There is 2011 G-20 commitment when UPA was in power and that was offtake of 2008 global crisis when the Lehman Brothers collapsed,\" he said. The Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, 2017, introduced in the Lok Sabha in August this year, has a bail-in clause, which some experts say brings potential harm to deposits in the form of savings accounts. (Also Read: FRDI Bill 2017: What it means for your money) The bill is currently undergoing scrutiny by a joint parliamentary committee. \"What do we do with that clause (bail-in). The committee has wise people which will make some recommendations. We will consider that. We are open minded. We are very clear and the level of protection the government would want would be much higher than level which existed till today,\" he said. The FRDI Bill proposes to create a framework for overseeing financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, non-banking financial services (NBFC) companies and stock exchanges in case of insolvency. The Resolution Corporation, proposed in the draft bill, would look after the process and prevent the banks from going bankrupt. It would do this by \"writing down of the liabilities\", a phrase some have interpreted as a \"bail in\". The draft bill empowers the Resolution Corporation to cancel the liability of a failing bank or convert the nature of the liability. It does not specify deposit insurance amount. At present, all deposits up to Rs 1 lakh are protected under the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act that is sought to be repealed by this bill. Jaitley added that the Indian economy growing at 7-8 per cent is the new normal and inflation is under control. Earlier this week, the government sought Parliaments approval for additional expenditure of Rs 66,113 crore, which includes funds to roll out schemes for providing electricity connections to the poor and payment of urea subsidies. Of this, the proposals involving net cash outgo aggregates to Rs 33,379.99 crore and gross additional expenditure, matched by savings of the ministries/departments or by enhanced receipts/recoveries aggregates to Rs 32,732.05 crore. The Lok Sabha today approved Supplementary Demand for Grants entailing additional expenditure to be done by various ministries and department. Jaitley also said the government has maintained glide path on fiscal deficit so far. \"The idea is that glide path of the fiscal deficit should always be maintained so that our borrowing keeps coming down,\" he said. The government has pegged the fiscal deficit target of 3.2 per cent of the GDP for the current fiscal.

Excerpts: Q: You have assumed the dual role of an administrator and a social reformer. Which role do you like more? Development has been my agenda from the very beginning, and it will remain so. Vikas ka kaam chalta rahega, but I have also always believed that in a society like ours, development alone wont lead to the desired change for the better. We should be cured of the social ills plaguing us or else the fruits of development wont reach the people. Q: When did it first come to your mind that drinking should be banned? It had been at the back of my mind for long... maybe since Karpoori Thakur banned it in the 1970s. Unfortunately, the ban was lifted after he ceased to be the CM. However, a dilemma of sorts gripped me whenever I (as the CM) thought about making Bihar a dry state. Questions like how to go about it and whether it would be successful worried me. One fine day, when I was attending a meeting of Jeevika women in Patna and had finished my speech, the audience demanded a ban on drinking. For an instant, I felt, all my dilemmas disappeared. Still shaky as I was, I decided to start with rural areas. (Smiles) I was happy to see people taking to the streets in support of prohibition in urban areas as well. I then decided to go for total prohibition in April (when the fiscal 2016-17 began). Q: What has been the impact? Our government did a study. Post-prohibition positives are galore. You have a look at the figures... (According to a study by the state Women Development Corporation, cases of sexual violence against women went down from 15 to 4% and those of physical violence from 54 to 5%; 85% women say fights in the neighbourhood have reduced; people spent Rs 1,331 on food per week as against Rs 1,005 they spent before prohibition and weekly expenditure on education went up from Rs 364 to Rs 612 after prohibition.) Q: There has also been opposition to it... Only in cities, only by few people... There cannot be any decision that pleases all. I am unfazed by the criticism. Q: How did you get the idea about fighting against child marriage and dowry? From the people of our state... I have this habit of reaching out to people and listening to them - be it in my Janata Ke Darbar Mein Mukhyamantri or Lok Samvad programmes. During my yatras, I keep my ears open to hear logon ki baatein. At one of my Lok Samvad events, a woman wanted us to do something about child marriage and dowry. Q: Did you decide to go for it that very day? No, but I found the idea appealing. For, these two evils are essentially against women whom my government has been trying to empower through measures like 50% quota in urban and rural local bodies, 35% reservation in state jobs, distribution of bicycles and uniforms to girl students and free college admissions up to the PG level, among other things. Our initiatives improved the states maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate (IMR), but we found that the IMR among baby girls was worse than that among baby boys. I could visualise a vicious cycle: Parents marry off their daughters young because they fear they will have to pay more dowry when they grow up; women die young because they are pregnant even before the nature readies their body for it. We discussed it internally in the government, and launched the twin campaigns on the Gandhi Jayanti on October 2 this year. Q: What next? Development and social reforms will continue. Many of our initiatives are being adopted by others. For instance, we had started electrifying all villages under our Mukhyamantri Vidyut Sambandh Yojana or Har Ghar Bijli scheme in November last year and the Centre decided to do it for the entire country in September this year. We have also created certain world-class landmarks despite opposition from certain quarters. They include Bihar Museum and Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre in Patna and a state-of-the-art convention centre at Rajgir. In three years from now, the old Patna Museum will undergo a complete makeover and become another major centre to showcase our culture and heritage.','CITY-PATNA','','2017-12-23 11:09:00','TNN | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 11:09 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(656,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/truckers-to-intensify-stir-from-tomorrow/articleshow/62213774.cms','Truckers to intensify stir from tomorrow','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62217734,width-400,resizemode-4/62217734.jpg]','PATNA: The Bihar Truck Owners Association on Friday threatened to block all roads leading to Patna from Sunday if the state government failed to meet their demands till Saturday night.

There is no other alternative,\" he said, adding that beside fighting it legally, the party would go to the people and fight it politically. Senior RJD leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui, a confidant of Prasad, said it was not right to comment on a judgement but the people were discussing how it is freedom for some people and jail for others in the same case. \"The layman is asking why it is jail for some and freedom for others? It is baffling how the BJP and JD(U) had predicted the verdict. This has created confusion among the people also,\" he said. \"The case was on excess withdrawal from Deogarh treasury. Laluji has been charged with connivance as he was the finance minister then - the charge is not direct. The withdrawal had been taking place since 1977. There were several chief ministers who were in charge of the finance department when Laluji was not the finance minister or the chief minister so why is he being singled out?\" Siddiqui asked. \"Lalujis going to jail is not new for RJD. He had been sent to jail on earlier occasions and every time RJD bounced back with double the strength. That is why we are still number one in Bihar,\" he said. The party was waiting to know the quantum of punishment to Prasad to be pronounced on January 3 and would then decide its course of action, Sidiqqui added.','CITY-PATNA','','2017-12-23 18:41:00','PTI | Dec 23, 2017, 18:41 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(661,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/woman-sits-on-rail-tracks-to-ensure-hubbys-rescue/articleshow/62213526.cms','Woman sits on rail tracks to ensure hubby’s rescue','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62217980,width-400,resizemode-4/62217980.jpg]','MUNGER: In a rare show of courage, a woman saved her husband from the clutches of criminals who had committed robbery on a running train between Akbarnagar and Bariarpur railway stations in Munger district on Thursday. Omprakash Singh, manager of a stone crusher plant and resident of Tin Pahar village under Rajmahal police station in Sahebganj district, was on way to Patna in the general compartment of 13133 Sealdah-Varanasi Express with his wife Munni Devi, sister-in-law Pratima Devi and two minor children. As the train reached Akbarnagar railway station, a group of 10 criminals boarded it posing as passengers. Three of them occupied the luggage seat. When the train started moving, Omprakash noticed that persons sitting on the luggage seat were trying to cut his bag with a razor. As he protested, the criminals started quarrelling with him. Omprakashs sister-in-law suffered minor injuries when she resisted the attempt of the robbers. The passengers of the train also raised an alarm and when the robbers tried to escape by jumping off the train, three of them were overpowered by the co-passengers. The remaining members of the gang managed to escape after kidnapping Omprakash. Munni Devi, wife of Omprakash, did not lose any moment and pulled the alarm chain of the train. The three robbers, who were overpowered by the passengers, were handed over to the police escort party. When the train stopped at the Bariarpur railway station, Munni Devi ran towards the engine of the train and sat on the track. All efforts to persuade her to vacate the railway track by the rail police and railway officials went in vain. She was adamant not to vacate the track unless her husband was rescued. A few passengers also joined her and squatted on the railway track. The station master and the rail police then informed the matter to GRP, Jamalpur. The SHO of Jamalpur GRP, Kripa Sagar, asked his Bariarpur counterpart to make a hot chase of the abductors. Finally, the police succeeded in rescuing Ompakash from a diara area, about three km away from the station. The train remained stranded at the Bariarpur railway station for at least an hour before Munni Devi vacated the rail track. An FIR has been lodged with Jamalpur GRP in connection with the incident on the basis of Omprakashs statement.

The RJD chief, along with former Bihar chief minister Jagannath Mishra, is one of the 34 accused in the case pertaining to alleged fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 89.27 lakh from the Deoghar district treasury between 1994 and 1996. Lalu left Patna on Friday evening to appear before the special CBI court at Ranchi. His younger son and leader of opposition in Bihar assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav accompanied him. \"Tejashwi and Tej Pratap are competent enough to lead the party with lakhs of workers and functionaries. RJD has come out stronger in times of crisis and the partys war against BJP will continue despite their deliberate efforts to send me behind bars,\" Lalu told reporters. Lalu was sentenced to five years in jail and fined Rs25 lakh by the CBI court in a different fodder scam case of fraudulent withdrawal of Rs37.5 crore from the Chaibasa treasury. He was later granted bail by the Supreme Court in December 2013. In 2014, the Jharkhand high court had stayed the trial against Lalu in four pending fodder scam cases on the ground that a person convicted in one case could not be tried in similar cases based on same witnesses and evidence. The Supreme Court, however, quashed the high court order in May this year and ordered Lalu to stand trial in all the pending fodder scam cases in which he was an accused. \"There are different cases related to fodder scam against me and separate trial is under way in each of them. Even though the allegation is the same in each case, I have replied to all the charges made by the CBI.

The RJD chief said efforts are being made by chief minister Nitish Kumar, his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi, BJP and RSS to suppress him. \"These people are trying to demean my family by lodging false cases against us. Had I surrendered before the BJP, there would not have been any case against me or my family. Are we among those who get scared and remain silent? We are facing it and will remain firm on our stand,\" Lalu said. On being asked about the possibility of his conviction, Lalu said: \"How can I say anything on what the court will do? It is a judicial process, even though these people (BJP and Nitish) want to send me to jail.\" The RJD chief said he would soon publish a book on his experience in fodder scam cases. \"The book will be on the truth behind the fodder scam,\" Lalu said.

The rise in temperature is higher, especially in the night time in winter season. Findings to this effect have been ascertained using satellite data in a study conducted by a team of scientists at Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) led by associate professor Pradhan Parth Sarthi of Centre for Environmental Science on the topic Urban Heat Island (UHI) in Bihar. The research work has also been accepted for publication in International Journal of Asia-Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Science, South Korea. In UHI, urban areas show relatively greater temperature than its rural areas, especially during night time. UHI, particularly after sunset, can have intensity of as much as 12 degrees C or between 10-15 degrees C during night. The difference between urban and rural surface temperature results in formation of UHI. The team has used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) -- data collected by satellite — of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for the period 2001-2015 over five major cities of Bihar. namely Bhagalpur, Gaya, Patna, Purnia and Muzzaffarpur. Each city was classified into urban, suburban and rural zones. \"The intensity of UHI shows a significant increasing trend. Out of five major cities, UHI is more over Patna followed by Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, Gaya and Purnia. UHI is stronger during winter months (November, December, January and February) as compared to other months due to large difference in surface temperature between urban, suburban and rural zones and forms a heat pockets over these areas. The difference in temperature is in the range of 5-8 degrees C,\" Partha Sarthi told TOI on Friday. The researchers have attributed the formation of UHI due to dense building structure in the urban area, which receives large amount of solar radiation during daytime and surface temperature increases, whereas in rural areas, it does not increase much during night time. \"Due to unplanned urbanization, urban and suburban areas of the city are losing vegetation cover and surface temperature is increasing. Such changes lead to the UHI phenomena. This trend has led to risk of rise in air pollution, heat-related biohazards and energy demand in the region,\" Partha said. The research team claimed the study emphasized the need of urban greening and environmentally sound town planning for the region to mitigate the changes. \"The outcome of this research can be of great use for the town planners, who finalize the land use pattern while planning a town,\" he said.','CITY-PATNA','Piyush Tripathi','2017-12-23 12:45:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 12:45 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(667,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/patients-evacuated-as-fire-breaks-out-in-delhi-hospital/articleshow/62222255.cms','Patients evacuated as fire breaks out in Delhi hospital','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62222524,width-400,resizemode-4/62222524.jpg?imglength=28799]','NEW DELHI: A major fire broke out on Saturday at a hospital in east Delhis Preet Vihar and 84 patients were evacuated from the building, officials said.

Many said this case was an exception and that things could go wrong when proper practices of disposal and cleanliness is overlooked by owners. Though such deaths have been occurred in sewage manholes and septic tanks, this is the first such recorded incident to happen in a gold smithy, sources said. While smithy owners say they usually employ people with experience in collecting, filtering and extracting gold dust, workers say the practice of going into a tank filled with water is unheard of. They remember the collection of gold dust as a safe process that was like a bonus for them. Almost two decades ago, gold dust in big smithies used to be collected in large brick and mortar structures constructed for the purpose, but they would not contain water. At the end of each day, dust from the smithy would be swept into these structures. It would accumulate throughout the year, and around the time of Ayudha pooja would be cleaned out and the dust processed. Smaller smithies, however, had no such provision. They would scrub their shops clean once in two to three months, taking out charcoal from furnaces and burning coir mats that workers sit on. \"We used to hand over the extracted gold to the smithy owner. For each gram of gold extracted we would be given ?100,\" says Murugan S, 40, a cleaner in smithies around Thomas Street. \"Earlier we used to get around 30g of gold on cleaning a workshop once. Now we hardly get 5g and we earn around ?700 for that,\" he says. Murugan works at more than 10 gold smithies in the area. To ensure that not a speck of gold slips through workers fingers, the big structures outside were replaced with plastic drums and tubs inside smithy shops, in which the dust after sweeping the premises was dumped. People such as Murugan were called in once in two months for rummaging through the grime to clean and extract the gold. Smithies have now turned into goldmines for another set of workers, those employed to clean toilets and do menial jobs at these establishments. They have built a business gathering gold dust, though a meagre amount, that slips the eye of the cleaners employed specifically to collect the metal. They collect the dust, take it to a pond nearby and use their own rudimentary means of extracting gold from it. The money from selling the gold adds to their daily wages.','CITY-COIMBATORE','Vishnu Swaroop','2017-12-23 07:38:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 07:38 IST','2017-12-23 19:21:59'),(671,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/farmers-stage-road-roko-over-irregular-power-supply/articleshow/62200444.cms','Farmers stage road roko over irregular power supply','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62203859,width-400,resizemode-4/62203859.jpg]','TIRUPUR: Farmers from Pongalur and its surrounding villages staged a road roko on Thursday in front of the TANGEDCO office on Palladam-Udumalpet road at Palladam for irregular power supply under a government scheme.

In a fresh proposal tabled before the standing committee of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the administration has quoted digging charge at the rate of Rs 2,350 per running meter, which is substantially lower than the earlier rate of Rs 5,500 per running meter. The distribution company had claimed that the charges were \"too high\" and had requested the administration to reconsider the same. Laying of underground cables had come to a standstill because of high digging charges. Civic officials said that acting on the request of the power utility, a fresh proposal was drafted with lower digging charges and it has now been tabled for further approval. A joint meeting of municipal commissioner and officials of the distribution company was held to discuss the issue. A reduction in digging charges would help the power utility to resume laying of underground cables, the official said. The distribution company has planned upgradation of power-related infrastructure in phases in the city at a cost of Rs 550 crore. Laying of underground power cables is among the major work planned by the power utility. Underground cables would significantly reduce interruptions in power supply. During discussion with PMC the power utility had claimed that being a public utility the civic administration should not charge higher rates for digging of roads.

All spaces, including footpaths, refuge islands and pedestrian crossings, should be accessible to differently abled persons,\" civic officials said. To turn this vision into reality, the civic body proposes to appoint a consultant who will focus on the needs of all road users, including pedestrians, cyclists, bus commuters and private vehicle users. The consultant would be required to improve and work on the existing transport. He will also take into account land use plans while conducting survey of pedestrian facilities, traffic and parking. \"Streetlight designing and mapping of existing utilities like underground cabling, water supply, among others, will also be the focus areas of the contractor. He will also take into consideration the environmental and social aspects,\" the officials added. For land use plans, mapping should be done for shopping areas, theatres and housing development projects, they said, adding that the consultant should also carry out a public space survey, detailing all informal site activities along the roads. When it comes to pedestrian facilities, the consultant will have to document the quality of existing amenities. \"He will also document width of the footpaths (if present) and the number of encroachments.

They added that the consultant will identify the most suitable, cost effective and green plans, including LED and CFL lamps and solar panels, for efficient lighting on the streets. For parking, the consultant should demarcate parking areas around each road. \"Three peak-hour parking surveys should be conducted in each zone. It should record the number of parked vehicles at each hour, details of double parking, haphazard and illegal parking,\" the officials said.

Akbaruddin was apparently referring to Chinas decision to repeatedly block a move by India to designate Masood Azhar, chief of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) militant group, as a global terrorist. On an issue as serious as designation of terrorist individuals and entities, the Council-mandated Sanctions Committees fail to make concrete progress and fall victim to \"narrow political and strategic concerns in some cases\", he said. Akbaruddin also referred to the fact that the UN-designated terrorist and Mumbai attack mastermind, Hafiz Saeed, was seeking to contest elections in Pakistan. Saeed had announced that his Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) will contest the 2018 general elections in Pakistan under the banner of the Milli Muslim League, which is yet to be registered with the Election Commission. \"In other cases where Sanctions Committees have designated terrorists, there are states who venture to mainstream UN designated terrorist individuals into their political process in total disregard of international law, thus putting our common security in peril,\" Akbaruddin said in his address to the Security Council.','INDIA','','2017-12-23 20:08:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 20:08 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(681,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stict-action-against-troublemakers-during-christmas-government/articleshow/62222766.cms','Strict action against troublemakers during Christmas: Government','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62222757,width-400,resizemode-4/62222757.jpg]','NEW DELHI: The Centre has issued an advisory to all states to ensure law and order during Christmas in the wake of fringe elements recently threatening some Christian community members against celebrating the festival, home minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday.

The report, an outcome of probe by the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) in 451 dairies across 10 states, had in October flagged a number of cruel practices in those dairies including milking of sick animals, indiscriminate use of painful Oxytocin injection, use of short tethers, abandonment of male calves and de-horning among others. The FIAPO had during its probe covered 50 dairies in five districts - Bareilly, Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Ghaziabad - in UP and 45 dairies in four districts - Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medak and Nalgonda - in Telangana. Referring to the probe report, director of animal husbandry in UP government, Charan Singh Yadav, issued a direction to all chief veterinary officers in the state asking them to ensure that the cattle must be kept in dairies strictly as per good animal husbandry practices and make the milk cooperatives in their respective districts aware of the guidelines for management of dairy. Yadavs note attached those guidelines which are formulated by studying the best practices suggested by the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI). It carries dos and donts for maintaining dairies including housing for cattle, healthcare, breeding, choice of species\\breed, management of calves, care of unwanted\\uneconomic animals and even providing a conducive atmosphere to bull and cattle for natural mating. Guideline on unwanted/uneconomic animals says that the low milk producing animals, non-reproductive animals, chronically ill animals and male calves must not be abandoned. \"Every facility must have a plan for humane management of unwanted animals.

Ironically, the outcome in Gujarat has exposed BJPs unimpressive performance in rural areas bordering Madhya Pradesh and the party is banking on some prominent names who the top leadership believes can prove their mettle and management skills in the state organisation set up ahead of the 2018 polls. Sources said BJP state chief Nandkumar Singh Chauhan had already given indications about a possibility of an organisational rejig, different opinions about senior leaders on the working of the state unit and dissension between them over state affairs have already set the mood of the high command to seek action. \"There are complaints lying with the party high command about differences between the state office-bearers which has led to discontentment among various groups. This has also resulted into weakening of the party organisation\", said some sources in BJP. Taking in view the assembly polls in 2018 and the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, where the party has promised to wrest all the 29 seats in the state, the possibility of a change is inevitable, sources added. They also named a few probable who in association with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan could manage party affairs and ensure victory. A few names that emerged during recent discussions are that of state home minister and CMs blue-eyed boy Bhupendra Singh, state public relations minister and BJP chief Amit Shahs close confidant Narottam Mishra, Lok Sabha member from Jabalpur Rakesh Singh, national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, Prime Minister Narendra Modis trusted lieutenant Narendra Singh Tomar and BJP in-charge of Manipur Prahlad Singh Patel. Sources said that the party high command is keeping all options open for the selection but, it was unwilling to disregard Chouhan in view of his excellent political influence and sway among rural voters. The frontrunner for the coveted post is Shivraj Singh Chouhans trusted aide Bhupendra Singh who was picked up by Chouhan as a Lok Sabha member from Sagar and was also given the most competitive home department. Singh shares a very good equation with the chief minister, said sources. Senior leaders Narottam Mishra and Rakesh Singh have also been named in the probable list by the high command. Rakesh Singh has maintained a close association with Prime Minister Modi during the last three years. His presence during every party meeting in Madhya Pradesh has given him the stature of a state representative in New Delhi. Similarly, Narottam Mishra has proved his mettle by managing Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat assembly elections. Party national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya has been endorsed by his followers and a few senior leaders of the anti-Shivraj camp but, he is unlikely to make the mark without the consent of chief minister Chouhan. Narendra Singh Tomar, who is also considered to be a close associate of Chouhan, also stands a chance to lead the state. He has been active during the 2013 assembly elections in the state and helped BJP win. BJPs backward class leader and Manipur in-charge, Prahlad Singh Patel, has also won the trust of the party high command by successfully able to form a BJP government in Manipur. Patel, a former close aide of Union minister Uma Bharti, had opposed Chouhans appointment as chief minister in 2005. Though he is close to Chouhan now after having differences with Bharti, he is unlikely to win the trust of Chouhans supporters as BJP state chief. Sources said that the party has also welcomed younger leaders but, as of now, there is no one in the list of probable or in the good book of chief minister Chouhan.','INDIA','Rajendra Sharma','2017-12-23 20:56:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 20:56 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(684,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fodder-scam-case-verdict-rjd-to-challenge-lalus-conviction-accuses-bjp-of-conspiracy/articleshow/62223606.cms','Fodder scam case verdict: RJD to challenge Lalus conviction, accuses BJP of conspiracy','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62223693,width-400,resizemode-4/62223693.jpg?imglength=131079]','PATNA: The RJD said it respects the judiciary and it would go in for appeal in the higher court against the conviction of party president Lalu Prasad on Saturday in the Deoghar treasury fodder scam case.

A former state minister, Singh also termed the CBI as \"Tota\" (parrot) and robot, controlled by the BJP-led central government. \"The people who had lost in 1995 assembly elections started conspiring against Lalu Ji, who got the mandate. They somehow got the CBI involved in the investigation in the case, which framed baseless charges against Lalu ... CBI is not a competent establishment and it got proved with the judgment given in 2G spectrum case on Thursday. The Supreme Court had also called CBI a \"caged parrot\" in the same 2G scam case,\" Singh said. On being asked the impact of fodder scam verdict on the party, Singh said: \"RJD would remain intact and we would continue to fight the battle against communal forces under the leadership of Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who has been approved by the national executive of the party to be our leader. The party would continue to fight for the cause of social justice against the BJP in a peaceful manner.\" Earlier today, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad was found guilty+ in one of the four pending fodder scam cases. The quantum of punishment will be pronounced on January 3. Special CBI judge Shivpal Singh pronounced the verdict in a packed courtroom. Lalu was among the 15 of the 22 accused found guilty by a special CBI court in Ranchi for the fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 84.5 lakh from the Deoghar district treasury between 1994 and 1996. The convicts, including the RJD chief, were taken into custody immediately after the pronouncement of the verdict.','INDIA','Piyush Tripathi','2017-12-23 23:38:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 23:38 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(685,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jdu-trains-gun-on-manmohan-singh-says-ex-pm-got-away-in-2g-spectrum-case/articleshow/62223468.cms','JD(U) trains gun on Manmohan Singh, says ex-PM got away in 2G spectrum case','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62223529,width-400,resizemode-4/62223529.jpg]','PATNA: JD(U) on Saturday trained its guns at former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whose office has been put in \"dock\" in 2G spectrum judgment and demanded action against PMOs two senior officials in the case. \"Following the 2G judgment on Thursday, Congress is saying that their stand has been vindicated.

The entire process which ultimately led to the filing of criminal cases, charging of various people commenced when the CAG threw those very sensational numbers and a presumptive loss of 1.76 lakh crore. \"And the irony is that the CAG report which completely vitiated the atmosphere, ruined reputations, demolished careers, that CAG report was not even a relied upon document by the prosecution during the 2G trial,\" he said.

While the Congress alleged that the CBI is behaving like a \"pet performing parrot of this government\", the BJP called the political alliance between RJD and Congress an \"alliance of corruption\". BJP leader JP Nadda attacked the United Progressive Alliance for seeking support from the RJD and said that todays verdict has made it clear that the alliance between Congress and RJD is an alliance of corruption, connivance and cheating the people of India. Congress leader Manish Tewari responded to the allegation and said that criminal cases and political alliance are two separate matters. \"This (case) has not started today. It had started in 1993-94. Between 1993-94 and today, we (Congress) have had a coalition with RJD, during UPA-1 they were part of the government, they were part of mahagatbandhan as well. So criminal cases and political alliance are two separate matters,\" he said. Tewari, in turn, questioned the BJP for its alleged refusal to investigate in the Srijan scam. He also questioned the credibility of the central investigating agency, CBI, and said that the institute is \"supposed to function in a fair, objective and transparent manner\". \"CBI is behaving like a pet performing parrot of this government. CBI and ED are not private lawyers, they are state instrumentalities. They are supposed to function in a fair, objective and transparent manner,\" he said. \"So as far as CBI and ED are concerned, if you think that JDU is in coalition with BJP, and there will be investigation against their ministers, this is like flying fictional kites,\" he added RJD leader Manoj Jha joined Tewari in levying allegations on the saffron party. \"...Politically I know this regime, they have this typical Standard Operating Procedure-Try to make a deal with your opposition, if you fail...scare them. Want to tell them-Your end has begun\", he said. Responding to Lalus allegation that the BJP had a role to play in his conviction, Deputy chief minister of Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi said that verdict was given by a judicial body and not BJP. \"Lalu was convicted for the first time during UPA regime & now blaming BJP? How can BJP influence the judicial process? Court has convicted Lalu, not BJP\", Modi said. Sushil Modi was responding to Lalu Prasads allegation where he had accused BJP of playing dirty games by distorting public perception against the political opponents with an aim to garner votes. The deputy chief minister further sharpened his attack on Lalu Prasad and said that it is unlikely that todays verdict will be a lesson for the RJD leader. \"Lalu Prasad, who is already convicted in one such case, is not going to mend his ways,\" Modi added. \"You reap what you sow,\" he said, adding the judgement was a lesson for politicians who amass benami properties in the name of Dalits, backwards and minorities. \"Had Lalu Prasad learnt any lesson from the fodder scam, he would not have indulged in the Lara scam in which he has dragged all his family members. He has not learnt from his past mistakes,\" Modi said. The Lara scam refers to the soil scandal in the state in which Prasads elder son Tej Pratap had allegedly sold soil worth Rs 90 lakh from an under-construction mall being built on a large patch of land owned by his family. Sushil Modi also lambasted Lalus pro-poor policies during his tenure as the chief minister of the state and said that the RJD leader was only one to have benefited from those policies following his involvement in the multi-crore fodder scam. 1990 ??? ???? ??? ??????????? ???? ?? ???? ?????? ??????-??????? ?? ????? ?? ??? ?????? ???? ???? ????? ?????? ???... https://t.co/MjIRXuVFxF — Sushil Kumar Modi (@SushilModi) 1514035290000 Tejashwi Yadav, the son of Lalu Prasad, was quick to counter Sushil Modis allegations and said that his father was targeted because he had challenged the political bigwigs. ???? ?? ??? ???? ?? ?????? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ?????? ?? ?? ?? ????? ?? ??????? ???????? ?? ???? ????? ?? ?????? ?... https://t.co/kww82hvN7h — Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi) 1514028143000 Later in the day, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra took a swipe at the Lalus tweet where he had evoked the names of world leaders, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther.

The number killed in the nine-month battle to liberate the city from the Islamic State group marauders has not been acknowledged by the U.S.-led coalition, the Iraqi government or the self-styled caliphate. But Mosuls gravediggers, its morgue workers and the volunteers who retrieve bodies from the citys rubble are keeping count. Iraqi or coalition forces are responsible for at least 3,200 civilian deaths from airstrikes, artillery fire or mortar rounds between October 2016 and the fall of the Islamic State group in July 2017, according to an Associated Press investigation that cross-referenced independent databases from non-governmental organizations. Most of those victims are simply described as \"crushed\" in health ministry reports. The coalition, which says it lacks the resources to send investigators into Mosul, acknowledges responsibility for only 326 of the deaths. \"It was the biggest assault on a city in a couple of generations, all told. And thousands died,\" said Chris Woods, head of Airwars , an independent organization that documents air and artillery strikes in Iraq and Syria and shared its database with the AP. \"There doesnt seem to be any disagreement about that, except from the federal government and the coalition. And understanding how those civilians died, and obviously ISIS played a big part in that as well, could help save a lot of lives the next time something like this has to happen. And the disinterest in any sort of investigation is very disheartening,\" Woods said, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State group. In addition to the Airwars database, the AP analyzed information from Amnesty International , Iraq Body Count and a United Nations report. The AP also obtained a list of 9,606 people killed during the operation from Mosuls morgue. Hundreds of dead civilians are believed to still be buried in the rubble. Of the nearly 10,000 deaths the AP found, around a third of the casualties died in bombardments by the U.S.-led coalition or Iraqi forces, the AP analysis found. Another third of the dead were killed in the Islamic State groups final frenzy of violence. And it could not be determined which side was responsible for the deaths of the remainder, who were cowering in neighborhoods battered by airstrikes, IS explosives and mortar rounds from all sides. But the morgue total would be many times higher than official tolls. Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi told the AP that 1,260 civilians were killed in the fighting. The U.S.-led coalition has not offered an overall figure. The coalition relies on drone footage, video from cameras mounted on weapons systems and pilot observations. Its investigators have neither visited the morgue nor requested its data. What is clear from the tallies is that as coalition and Iraqi government forces increased their pace, civilians were dying in ever higher numbers at the hands of their liberators: from 20 the week the operation began in mid-October 2016 to 303 in a single week at the end of June 2017, according to the AP tally. Abdel-Hafiz Mohammed, who kept his job as undertaker throughout the militants rule, has carved approximately 2,000 headstones for the al-Jadidah graveyard since October 2016. After the city fell to IS in 2014, undertakers like him handled the victims of beheadings and stonings; there were men accused of homosexuality who had been flung from rooftops. But once the operation to free the city started, the scope of Mohammeds work changed yet again. \"Now I carve stones for entire families,\" Mohammed said, gesturing to a stack of four headstones, all bearing the same name. \"Its a single family, all killed in an airstrike.\" DYING AT HOME, ON THE FRONT Mosul was home to more than a million civilians before the fight to retake it from IS. Fearing a massive humanitarian crisis, the Iraqi government dropped leaflets or had soldiers tell families to stay put as the final battle loomed in late 2016. Thousands were trapped when the front line enveloped densely populated neighborhoods. Blast injuries, gunshot and shrapnel killed thousands as the Mosul operation ground westward, according to morgue documents. When Iraqi forces became bogged down in late December, the Pentagon adjusted the rules regarding the use of airpower, allowing airstrikes to be called in by more ground commanders with less chain-of-command oversight. At the same time, Islamic State group fighters took thousands of civilians with them in their retreat west. They packed hundreds of families into schools and government buildings, sometimes shunting civilians through tunnels from one fighting position to another. They expected the tactic would dissuade airstrikes and artillery. They were wrong. As the fight punched into western Mosul, the morgue logs filled with civilians increasingly killed by being \"blown to pieces.\" By early March, Iraqi officials and the U.S.-led coalition could see that civilian deaths were spiking, but held the course. The result, in Mosul and later in the groups Syrian stronghold of Raqqa, was a city left in ruins by the battle to save it. Most of the civilians killed in west Mosul died under the weight of collapsed buildings, hit by airstrikes, mortars, artillery shells or IS-laid explosives. The morgue provided lists of names of civilians and place of death. Names often included entire families. The coalition has defended its operational choices, saying it was the Islamic State group that put civilians in danger as it clung to power. \"It is simply irresponsible to focus criticism on inadvertent casualties caused by the Coalitions war to defeat ISIS,\" Col. Thomas Veale, a coalition spokesman, told the AP in response to questions about civilian deaths. \"Without the Coalitions air and ground campaign against ISIS, there would have inevitably been additional years, if not decades of suffering and needless death and mutilation in Syria and Iraq at the hands of terrorists who lack any ethical or moral standards,\" he added. Civilian deaths in the second half of the battle reflected the looser rules of engagement for airstrikes and the sheer numbers of trapped residents. From Oct. 17 to Feb. 19, the AP tally found at least 576 deaths by coalition or Iraqi munitions. From Feb. 19 — when the fight crossed the Tigris River _ to mid-July, there were nearly 2,400 civilian deaths. That total is in addition to the 326 confirmed by the coalition in the city. The U.S. and Australia are the only two coalition countries to acknowledge civilian deaths, though France had fighter jets and artillery and the UK also carried out airstrikes. Of the nearly 10,000 names listed by the morgue, around 4,200 were confirmed as civilian dead in the battle. The AP discarded names that were obviously those of Islamic State group fighters and casualties brought in from outside Mosul. Among the remaining 6,000 are likely some number of Islamic State group extremists, but the morgue civilian toll tracks closely with numbers gathered during the battle itself by Airwars and others. Neither toll includes thousands of people killed by the Islamic State group who are believed to be in mass graves in and around Mosul, including as many as 4,000 in the natural crevasse known as Khasfa. Imad Ibrahim, a civil defense rescuer from west Mosul, survived the battle to retake the city and is now tasked with excavating the dead. He mostly works in the Old City, where on a recent day the streets still reeked of rotting flesh. \"Sometimes you can see the bodies. Theyre visible under the rubble. Other times we dig for hours, and suddenly find 15 to 30 all in one place. Thats when you know they were sheltering, hiding from the airstrikes,\" Ibrahim said. Behind him an excavator dug through jagged cement blocks, searching for the body of a woman who was hiding in her home when it was hit by an airstrike. Ibrahim said he spent years waiting for liberation, but the victory itself was hollow. \"Honestly, none of this was worth it.\" DIGGING INTO DEATH By dawn, dozens of Mosul families begin to line up outside the civil defense office each day. One by one they flatly describe their personal tragedies: \"We buried my cousins body in the garden under the tree.\" \"My mother was hiding in the back of the house, near the kitchen when the airstrike hit her home.\" \"We buried my father in the street in front of our home after he was shot.\" Radwan Majid said he lost both his children to an airstrike in May. \"There were three Daesh in front of my house, so when the airstrike hit, it also killed my children,\" he said, using an Arabic acronym for the group. \"We can see their bodies under the rubble, but we cant reach them by ourselves,\" he said. \"All I want is to give them a proper burial.\" Reports of civilian deaths began to dominate military planning meetings in Baghdad in February and early March, according to a senior Western diplomat who was present but not authorized to speak on the record. After a single coalition strike killed more than 100 civilians in Mosuls al-Jadidah neighborhood on March 17, the entire fight was put on hold for three weeks. Under intense international pressure , the coalition sent a team into the city to investigate. Iraqs special forces units were instructed that they were no longer allowed to call in strikes on buildings. Instead, the forces were told to call in airstrikes on gardens and roads adjacent to IS group targets. A WhatsApp group shared by coalition advisers and Iraqi forces coordinating airstrikes previously named \"killing daesh 24/7\" was wryly renamed \"scaring daesh 24/7.\" \"It was clear that the whole strategy in western Mosul had to be reconfigured,\" said the Western diplomat. But on the ground, Iraqi special forces officers said after the operational pause, they returned to the fight just as before. The WhatsApp groups name was changed back to \"killing daesh.\" The Pentagon investigation into the March strike concluded that a U.S. bomb resulted in the deaths of 105 civilians but ultimately blamed secondary explosions from IS-laid bombs. The 500-pound (227-kilogram) bomb, the investigation concluded, \"appropriately balanced the military necessity of neutralizing (two IS) snipers.\" Witnesses and survivors told the AP that IS had not set any explosives in the house that was hit. The house was packed with families sheltering from the fighting. At the time, just two American officers were fielding all allegations of civilian casualties in Iraq and Syria from a base in Kuwait. The team now has seven members, though none sets foot inside Mosul or routinely collects physical evidence. The Americans say they do not have the resources to send a team into Mosul; an AP reporter visited the morgue six times in six weeks and spoke to morgue officials and staffers dozens of times in person and over the phone. Because of what the coalition considers insufficient information, the majority of civilian casualty allegations are deemed \"not credible\" before an investigation ever begins . Col. Joseph Scrocca, a coalition spokesman, defended the coalition figures in an interview in May, saying they may seem low because of a meticulous process designed to \"get to the truth\" and help protect civilians in the future. \"I do believe the victims of these strikes deserve to know what happened to their families, Scrocca said. \"We owe them that.\" Daoud Salem Mahmoud survived the fight for the Old City by hiding with his family in a windowless room deep inside their home. With the fight over, Mahmoud now returns to his neighborhood daily to retrieve the dead. Hes recovered hundreds of bodies of extended family members and neighbors. A large, imposing figure, Mahmoud breaks down in tears when asked to describe specific events at the height of the violence. But without a moment of hesitation, he said he believes the fight to retake the city was worthwhile. Despite the death and destruction, he said he now feels like his family has a chance at a future brighter than his own. \"Everything can be rebuilt. Its the lives lost that cannot be replaced,\" he said. Then, shaking his head, he added, \"This war, it turned Mosul into a graveyard.\"','WORLD-MIDDLE-EAST','','2017-12-21 14:36:00','AP | Dec 21, 2017, 14:36 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(701,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/2017-mexicos-most-violent-year-in-two-decades-officials/articleshow/62218237.cms','2017 Mexicos most violent year in two decades: officials','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62218261,width-400,resizemode-4/62218261.jpg]','MEXICO CITY: 2017 was Mexicos most violent year in two decades, with 23,101 murders carried out between January and November, according to official figures released Friday.

He said a total of 36 planes and four helicopters have returned to their permanent bases, while 157 motor vehicles were delivered to Russia by sea. Special forces troops, a medical unit, a battalion of military police, doctors and deminers have been brought back to Russia, he added. Putin made a surprise visit to Syria last week where he ordered the start of a pullout of Russian troops, saying their task in the war-torn country had been largely completed. Russia became involved in the multi-front conflict in September 2015, when it began an aerial campaign in support of President Bashar al-Assads military.

The \"low-ranking\" soldier was spotted by South Korean soldiers using surveillance equipment as he crossed the midwestern part of the land border in thick fog and made his way to a guard post, a ministry spokesman said. No shots were fired at the time, he said, but South Korean troops later fired around 20 rounds from a K-3 machine gun to warn off Northern guards who approached the border apparently looking for the man. The incident came a month after a rare and dramatic defection by a soldier at Panmunjom, the truce village where opposing forces confront each other across a concrete dividing line. On that occasion the defector drove to the heavily-guarded border at speed and ran across under a hail of bullets from his own side. He was hit at least four times. Footage showed the badly injured man being pulled to safety by two South Korean soldiers who crawled to reach him just south of the demarcation line. He has since been recovering in hospital in the South. Away from Panmunjom, the rest of the 4-kilometre (2.5-mile) -wide DMZ bristles with barbed wire and is littered with minefields, making any crossing extremely hazardous. Thursdays defection was the fourth by a soldier across the DMZ this year. Two North Korean civilians also defected this week after being found drifting in a rickety engineless boat off Souths eastern coast, Yonhap news agency reported, citing the Unification Ministry, which handles relations with the North. They were spotted by a South Korean surveillance aircraft and picked up by a nearby navy vessel, it said. The developments bring this years total for the number of people defecting directly to the South to 15, a Joint Chiefs of Staff tally showed -- three times as many as in 2016. Around 30,000 North Koreans have fled repression and poverty in their homeland to reach the South over the decades since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, with 1,418 doing so last year according to Unification Ministry data. The vast majority go first to China, with which the North shares a long border, and where they face the risk of being repatriated to an uncertain fate if caught. They travel on to the South later, often via another country. In Novembers Panmunjom incident, footage showed a North Korean guard briefly crossing the border in hot pursuit before retreating. The US-led United Nations Command said the Norths forces had violated the 1953 ceasefire that ended Korean War hostilities both by physically crossing the line and firing weapons over it. The North Korean soldier, 24-year-old Oh Chong-Song, underwent multiple operations for his gunshot wounds at Ajou University Hospital in Seoul and was transferred to a military hospital last week, Yonhap said.

The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers several West Coast states, also said its ruling would be put on hold pending a decision on the latest version of the travel ban from the Trump administration by the US Supreme Court. Since taking office in January, Trump has been struggling to enact a ban that passes court muster. A three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit narrowed a previous injunction from a lower federal court to those people \"with a credible bona fide relationship with the United States.\" It also said that while the US president has broad powers to regulate the entry of immigrants into the United States, those powers are not without limits. \"We conclude that the Presidents issuance of the Proclamation once again exceeds the scope of his delegated authority,\" the panel said. The ban targets people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen seeking to enter the United States. The Republican president has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism. The state of Hawaii, however, challenged it in court, and a Honolulu federal judge said it exceeded Trumps powers under immigration law. Trumps ban also covers people from North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela, but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect. The same three judge 9th Circuit panel, which limited a previous version of Trumps ban, heard arguments earlier this month. Some of the judges appeared more cautious toward the idea of blocking the presidents policy. Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, which caused chaos at airports and mass protests. He issued a revised one in March after the first was blocked by federal courts. That expired in September after a long court fight, and was replaced with the current version. The ban has some exceptions. Certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and any applicant can ask for an individual waiver. US Justice Department officials were not immediately available for comment.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-23 07:06:00','Reuters | Dec 23, 2017, 07:06 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(706,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/un-mulls-new-north-korea-sanctions-could-vote-on-friday-diplomats/articleshow/62198525.cms','UN mulls new North Korea sanctions, could vote on Friday: Diplomats','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62198594,width-400,resizemode-4/62198594.jpg]','UNITED NATIONS: A US-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution seeks to ban nearly 90 per cent of refined petroleum product exports to North Korea and the repatriation of North Koreans working abroad, according to the text seen by Reuters on Thursday. The draft resolution was circulated to the 15-member council on Thursday and could be voted on as early as Friday, said diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity. While it was not immediately clear how China would vote, traditionally a draft resolution on North Korea is not given to the full council until agreed by Beijing and Washington. The United States has been negotiating with China on the draft resolution for the past week, diplomats said. In order to pass, a resolution needs nine of the 15 Security Council members to vote in favor and no vetoes by any of the five permanent members: the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China. The resolution is in response to North Koreas launch of a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile on November 29, which it said could reach all of the US mainland and South Korea. If adopted, it would be the 10th resolution imposing new sanctions on North Korea over its missile and nuclear programs since 2006. In September, the council put a cap of 2 million barrels a year on refined petroleum product exports to North Korea. The new draft resolution seeks to further reduce that cap to 500,000 barrels annually. In a bid to further choke North Koreas external sources of funding, the draft text also seeks to ban North Korean exports of food products, machinery, electrical equipment, earth and stone, including magnesite and magnesia; wood; and vessels. The draft resolution would also ban exports to North Korea of industrial equipment, machinery, transportation vehicles, and industrial metals. In August, the council capped the number of North Koreans working abroad at the current level. Then in September it decided that the employment of North Korean workers abroad had to be authorized by a Security Council committee. The new draft resolution would demand the repatriation of North Koreans working abroad within 12 months. It also seeks to allow countries to seize, inspect and freeze any vessel in their ports or territorial waters that they believe was carrying banned cargo or involved in prohibited activities. If adopted, the council would also subject 19 new North Korean individuals and the Ministry of the Peoples Armed Forces to a global asset freeze and travel ban.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-21 22:19:00','Reuters | Updated: Dec 21, 2017, 22:19 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(707,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-threatens-funding-cuts-ahead-of-jerusalem-vote/articleshow/62185102.cms','Trump threatens funding cuts ahead of Jerusalem vote','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62185100,width-400,resizemode-4/62185100.jpg]','WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump threatened funding cuts for unspecified countries as the UN General Assembly prepared to vote on condemning Washingtons recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \"All these nations that take our money and then vote against us at the Security Council and they vote against us potentially at the Assembly,\" Trump said at the White House. \"They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us.

The outcome of Thursdays election, in which an anti-secession party also made its best showing to date, did yield a sign of possible movement: Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and the pro-independence regional president he removed from office said they were ready to talk. However, the two men made clear they were working off different sets of presumptions for a potential dialogue. Speaking from Brussels, where he fled nearly eight weeks ago to avoid being arrested on possible rebellion and sedition charges, ex-Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said he would talk with Rajoy under one condition their meeting would have to be outside Spain. Even with Puigdemont campaigning from Belgium, his Together for Catalonia party snared 34 of the regional parliaments 135 seats, making it the most popular separatist party. A man stands next to a banner reading in Catalan: Freedom for Political Prisoners in support of Catalonia politicians who have been jailed on charges of sedition at Sant Jaume Square in Barcelona As the leading separatist candidate, Puigdemont could try to become president of Catalonia again. The new parliament would not be able to elect him for the post unless he returns to Barcelona, the regional capital, but he is likely to be arrested when he turns up on Spanish soil. The election results nonetheless strengthened Puigdemonts hand, as separatist politicians won 70 of the parliament seats altogether. Rajoys conservative Popular Party secured just three seats, a major embarrassment for the prime minister who took unprecedented steps to put down the Catalan independence movement. \"More than 2 million people are in favor of Catalonias independence,\" Puigdemont said, referring to the election results. \"Recognizing reality is vital if we are to find a solution.\" Rajoy ignored his adversarys appeal for a meeting, declaring instead that the election show a \"new era based on dialogue\" was beginning in Catalonia. He also set out a condition of his own for any talks: separatist officeholders must abide by the Spanish Constitution, which says the country is \"indivisible.\" \"I will make an effort to dialogue with the government that forms in Catalonia, but I expect it to stop acting unilaterally and outside the law,\" Rajoy said during a media briefing. People walking by the sea in Barcelona said they wanted the leaders to settle their differences through negotiation. Product manager Beatriz Versosa, 33, said \"the rulers of Spain and Catalonia (must) put themselves in the place of citizens and understand that they must solve the issue and set aside the most extreme positions.\" Mercedes Aras, meanwhile, wanted Spanish authorities to \"sit down to negotiate on a realistic basis.\" Negotiations in the past involved a compromise of granting Catalonia more self-government rights, but separatists are likely to use their regained majority to push for a binding referendum on secession. Rajoy, invoking constitutional authority to temporarily take over a regions affairs, fired the Catalan government that Puigdemont led and dissolved the regional parliament after separatist lawmakers declared Catalonias independence in October. They based the declaration on results from a voter referendum that Spanish courts ruled was illegal. The prime minister also called the election held Thursday. With statistics showing the regions moves toward independence hurting the Catalan economy, Rajoy hoped the vote would sideline the separatist movement. The pro-Spain Ciutadans (Citizens) collected the most votes of any single party and its biggest electoral triumph since the business-friendly party was founded just over 10 years ago. But its 37 seats arent enough for it to form a regional government on its own. The parties that favor an independent Catalonia did better than polls had predicted. Along with the 34 seats won by Puigdemonts party, its main separatist rival, the left-wing republican ERC party, collected 32 seats. ERC leader Oriol Junqueras _ Puigdemonts No. 2 in the previous Catalan government _ is jailed near Madrid while an investigation into possible sedition and rebellion by the separatist leaders continues. The radical, anti-capitalist CUP won four seats. The separatist parties history of squabbling wont make it easy for them to put together a Cabinet. Fernando Vallespin, a professor of political studies at Madrids Autonomous University, said multiple unresolved issues cloud the immediate future of Catalonia, including the legal issues and whether the pro-independence parties can find common ground. \"It really is an unknown situation,\" he said.','WORLD-EUROPE','','2017-12-23 07:16:00','AP | Dec 23, 2017, 07:16 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(709,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russian-hackers-targeted-more-than-200-journalists-globally/articleshow/62206552.cms','Russian hackers targeted more than 200 journalists globally','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62206556,width-400,resizemode-4/62206556.jpg]','PARIS: Russian television anchor Pavel Lobkov was in the studio getting ready for his show when jarring news flashed across his phone: Some of his most intimate messages had just been published to the web. Days earlier, the veteran journalist had come out live on air as HIV-positive, a taboo-breaking revelation that drew responses from hundreds of Russians fighting their own lonely struggles with the virus. Now hed been hacked. \"These were very personal messages,\" Lobkov said in a recent interview, describing a frantic call to his lawyer in an abortive effort to stop the spread of nearly 300 pages of Facebook correspondence, including sexually explicit messages. Even two years later, he said, \"its a very traumatic story.\" The Associated Press found that Lobkov was targeted by the hacking group known as Fancy Bear in March 2015, nine months before his messages were leaked. He was one of at least 200 journalists, publishers and bloggers targeted by the group as early as mid-2014 and as recently as a few months ago. The AP identified journalists as the third-largest group on a hacking hit list obtained from cybersecurity firm Secureworks, after diplomatic personnel and U.S. Democrats. About 50 of the journalists worked at The New York Times. Another 50 were either foreign correspondents based in Moscow or Russian reporters like Lobkov who worked for independent news outlets. Others were prominent media figures in Ukraine, Moldova, the Baltics or Washington. The list of journalists provides new evidence for the U.S. intelligence communitys conclusion that Fancy Bear acted on behalf of the Russian government when it intervened in the U.S. presidential election. Spy agencies say the hackers were working to help Republican Donald Trump. The Russian government has denied interfering in the American election. Previous AP reporting has shown how Fancy Bear — which Secureworks nicknamed Iron Twilight — used phishing emails to try to compromise Russian opposition leaders, Ukrainian politicians and U.S. intelligence figures, along with Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and more than 130 other Democrats. Lobkov, 50, said he saw hacks like the one that turned his day upside-down in December 2015 as dress rehearsals for the email leaks that struck the Democrats in the United States the following year. \"I think the hackers in the service of the Fatherland were long getting their training on our lot before venturing outside.\" \"CLASSIC KGB TACTIC\" New Yorker writer Masha Gessen said it was also in 2015 — when Secureworks first detected attempts to break into her Gmail — that she began noticing people who seemed to materialize next to her in public places in New York and speak loudly in Russian into their phones, as if trying to be overheard. She said this only happened when she put appointments into the online calendar linked to her Google account. Gessen, the author of a book about Russian President Vladimir Putins rise to power, said she saw the incidents as threats. \"It was really obvious,\" she said. \"It was a classic KGB intimidation tactic.\" Other U.S.-based journalists targeted include Josh Rogin, a Washington Post columnist, and Shane Harris, who was covering the intelligence community for The Daily Beast in 2015. Harris said he dodged the phishing attempt, forwarding the email to a source in the security industry who told him almost immediately that Fancy Bear was involved. In Russia, the majority of journalists targeted by the hackers worked for independent news outlets like Novaya Gazeta or Vedomosti, though a few — such as Tina Kandelaki and Ksenia Sobchak — are more mainstream. Sobchak has even launched an improbable bid for the Russian presidency. Investigative reporter Roman Shleynov noted that the Gmail hackers targeted was the one he used while working on the Panama Papers, the expose of international tax avoidance that implicated members of Putins inner circle. Fancy Bear also pursued more than 30 media targets in Ukraine, including many journalists at the Kyiv Post and others who have reported from the front lines of the Russia-backed war in the countrys east. Nataliya Gumenyuk, co-founder of Ukrainian internet news site Hromadske, said the hackers were hunting for compromising information. \"The idea was to discredit the independent Ukrainian voices,\" she said. The hackers also tried to break into the personal Gmail account of Ellen Barry, The New York Times former Moscow bureau chief. Her newspaper appears to have been a favorite target. Fancy Bear sent phishing emails to roughly 50 of Barrys colleagues at The Times in late 2014, according to two people familiar with the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential data. The Times confirmed in a brief statement that its employees received the malicious messages, but the newspaper declined to comment further. Some journalists saw their presence on the hackers hit list as vindication. Among them were CNN security analyst Michael Weiss and Brookings Institution visiting fellow Jamie Kirchick, who took the news as a badge of honor. \"Im very proud to hear that,\" Kirchick said. The Committee to Protect Journalists said the wide net cast by Fancy Bear underscores efforts by governments worldwide to use hacking against journalists. \"Its about gaining access to sources and intimidating those journalists,\" said Courtney C. Radsch, the groups advocacy director. In Russia, the stakes are particularly high. The committee has counted 38 murders of journalists there since 1992. Many journalists told the AP they knew they were under threat, explaining that they had added a second layer of password protection to their emails and only chatted over encrypted messaging apps like Telegram, WhatsApp or Signal. Fancy Bear target Ekaterina Vinokurova, who works for regional media outlet Znak, said she routinely deletes her emails. \"I understand that my accounts may be hacked at any time,\" she said in a telephone interview. \"Im ready for them.\" \"IVE SEEN WHAT THEY COULD DO\" Its not just whom the hackers tried to spy on that points to the Russian government. Its when. Maria Titizian, an Armenian journalist, immediately found significance in the date she was targeted: June 26, 2015. \"It was Electric Yerevan,\" she said, referring to protests over rising energy bills that she reported on. The protests that rocked Armenias capital that summer were initially seen by some in Moscow as a threat to Russian influence. Titizian said her outspoken criticism of the Kremlins \"colonial attitude\" toward Armenia could have made her a target. Eliot Higgins, whose open source journalism site Bellingcat repeatedly crops up on the target list, said the phishing attempts seemed to begin \"once we started really making strong statements about MH17,\" the Malaysian airliner shot out of the sky over eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing 298 people. Bellingcat played a key role in marshaling the evidence that the plane was destroyed by a Russian missile — Moscows denials notwithstanding. The clearest timing for a hacking attempt may have been that of Adrian Chen. On June 2, 2015, Chen published a prescient expose of the Internet Research Agency, the Russian \"troll factory\" that won fresh infamy in October over revelations that it had manufactured make-believe Americans to pollute social media with toxic rhetoric. Eight days after Chen published his big story, Fancy Bear tried to break into his account. Chen, who has regularly written about the darker recesses of the internet, said having a lifetime of private messages exposed to the internet could be devastating. \"Ive covered a lot of these leaks,\" he said. \"Ive seen what they could do.\"','WORLD-EUROPE','','2017-12-22 13:38:00','AP | Updated: Dec 22, 2017, 13:38 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(710,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/29-dead-in-fitness-centre-blaze-in-s-korea-fire-service/articleshow/62196654.cms','29 dead in fitness centre blaze in S.

The fire broke out around 4:00pm local time (0700 GMT) and quickly engulfed the entire eight-storey building, leaving many trapped inside. Twenty victims were found at a public sauna and others elsewhere in the building that houses a fitness centre, public bath and restaurants, the National Fire Agency said. \"The fire produced so much toxic smoke so quickly, leaving many people unable to evacuate,\" an agency spokesman said. Many victims appeared to been unaware of the fire raging outside the bathhouse until it became impossible to flee, he added. The death toll may rise further as firefighters continue to search the building, the spokesman said. Television footage showed the building consumed by orange flames and issuing dark plumes of smoke, as several people stood waiting to be rescued from an outdoor terrace. Some were seen jumping from the building onto air mattresses laid out on the ground as dozens of fire trucks and more than 100 firefighters rushed to the scene. The blaze -- believed to have started in a parking lot on the first floor -- has been mostly put out, the fire agency said. Jecheon is in central South Korea, about 120 kilometres (75 miles) southeast of the capital Seoul. The disaster forced organisers of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics to cancel a planned torch relay event at the city on Friday, Yonhap news agency said, citing the organisers. \"We decided to cancel the event to mourn the victims,\" an unnamed official at the organising committee was quoted as saying. The fire is South Koreas worst since 2008 when a blaze at a warehouse in the city of Icheon killed 40 workers. President Moon Jae-In expressed regret over the accident and urged officials to make \"utmost efforts\" for rescue and search operations, his office said. The worst fire ever to hit modern South Korea was an arson attack on a subway station in the southeastern city of Daegu that left 192 people dead and nearly 150 injured in 2003.','WORLD-REST-OF-WORLD','','2017-12-21 19:44:00','AFP | Dec 21, 2017, 19:44 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(711,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thomas-fire-mostly-contained-in-charred-california/articleshow/62189016.cms','Thomas fire mostly contained in charred California','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62189017,width-400,resizemode-4/62189017.jpg]','LOS ANGELES: Firefighters in California on Wednesday said the massive Thomas wildfire -- about the size of sprawling Los Angeles -- was about 60 percent contained but they warned strong winds were still forecast.

Damian Green, who was ousted as first secretary of state, maintains he did not use pornography on his office computers, but he agreed he had not been forthcoming in statements made about the matter in November. A report by Mays Cabinet secretary concluded Green had made misleading statements regarding his knowledge about the indecent images found by police. \"I accept that I should have been clear in my press statements that police lawyers talked to my lawyers in 2008 about the pornography on the computers, and that the police raised it with me in a subsequent phone call in 2013,\" Green said in his resignation letter, which was made public Wednesday night. May said she asked Green for his resignation after the investigation concluded he had not been open about the matter. \"I have also carefully considered the reports conclusions in relation to two statements you made on 4 and 11 November which you now accept were inaccurate and misleading,\" the prime minister wrote in a letter requesting Green to step aside. She said he had fallen short of the standards expected of him. \"It is therefore with deep regret, and enduring gratitude for the contribution you have made over many years, that I asked you to resign from the Government and have accepted your resignation,\" May wrote. Green was a vital political ally who acted as a de facto deputy prime minister and supported May in her difficult Brexit negotiations. His removal will cost her an important supporter as she tries to balance competing visions of Brexit within her Cabinet. Green had claimed earlier he was the victim of a smear campaign. The pornography was found on his office computer during a police investigation of government leaks. The Cabinet investigation did not yield a conclusion about sexual misconduct allegations writer Kate Maltby made against Green. Maltby said Green had \"fleetingly\" touched her knee during a meeting in a pub and later sent a suggestive text after a picture of her wearing a corset appeared in a newspaper. The cabinet secretary investigation said it was \"not possible to reach a definitive conclusion\" on whether Greens behavior with Maltby was appropriate wily, but added that her account was \"plausible.\" Green is among a number of British politicians who have stepped down or been forced out in recent weeks as a wave of allegations of sexual harassment has surfaced.','WORLD-UK','','2017-12-21 11:12:00','AP | Updated: Dec 21, 2017, 11:12 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(713,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/peru-declares-north-korea-diplomats-persona-non-grata/articleshow/62221857.cms','Peru declares North Korea diplomats persona non grata','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62221983,width-400,resizemode-4/62221983.jpg]','LIMA: Peru has declared two North Korean diplomats persona non grata and ordered them to leave the country within 15 days, according to a foreign ministry statement. \"The Peruvian government has informed the North Korean embassy of its decision to declare First Secretary Pak Myong Chol and Third Secretary Ji Hyok persona non grata,\" the ministry said late yesterday.

May praised the Royal Air Force (RAF) men and women at Britains Akrotiri base in the country for their key role on Operation Shader, the codename for the fight against Islamic State (ISIS), and diminishing the hold of terrorists in the Middle East. \"Just three years ago, Daesh [ISIS] declared a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, a safe haven in which to carry out the most barbaric acts and in which to plot murder on our streets at home,\" she said. \"But today, thanks in very large part to your efforts, the so-called caliphate has been crushed and no longer holds significant territory in Iraq and Syria. You should be incredibly proud of that achievement,\" May said. The RAF base in Cyprus is at the heart of the UKs operations in Iraq and Syria. It is home to 2,000 military personnel and has been the launch point for more than 1,300 sorties to Iraq and more than 250 to Syria since the US-led action against ISIS began. \"Its from here that you have conducted more than 1,600 air strikes against Daesh targets and supported more than 1,450 personnel working with our allies and partners in Jordan and Iraq to fight Daesh and prevent its re-emergence,\" she said. Standing in front of a Typhoon fighter jet to speak to 100 servicemen and women at RAF Akrotiri, May said that British military intervention was still needed in the region to ensure the terror group did not regroup or give way to a splinter force. Her Voyager plane landed at Akrotiri last night after she flew in from Warsaw following talks with her Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki. In her six-minute speech at the windswept Mediterranean airbase, May hailed the RAF on the eve of its centenary, which is celebrated in 2018. \"I hope that as a nation in this special year ahead we can collectively raise the national consciousness of the work you do and the sacrifices that you make in the service of others. As Prime Minister, I will do everything I can to lead the nation in this endeavour, for you are quite simply the pride of our nation, and that is how you should be treated,\" she said. As part of her \"big thank you\" message to the troops, the British PM praised the troops for taking down enemies and standing by allies when the going gets tough. She warned that ISIS would still seek \"new ungoverned spaces from which to plot and carry out attack\" and that it was vital for Britain to continue to support its allies in the Middle East.','WORLD-UK','','2017-12-22 19:59:00','PTI | Dec 22, 2017, 19:59 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(715,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/19-hurt-as-car-ploughs-into-crowd-in-melbourne-police/articleshow/62194895.cms','19 hurt as car ploughs into crowd in Melbourne: Police','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62195398,width-400,resizemode-4/62195398.jpg]','MELBOURNE: A car ploughed into a crowd in Australias second-largest city on Thursday injuring 19 people in what police said was a \"deliberate act\" but one they did not believe was terror related.

The car was driven \"intentionally\" through the intersection and collided with a \"large number\" of pedestrians, Acting Chief Commissioner Shane Patton told reporters in Melbourne. The driver \"has a history of drug use and mental health issues... At this time we do not have any evidence or intelligence to indicate a connection with terrorism\" or extremism, he said. The man was arrested after a tussle with an off-duty police officer. Investigators were waiting to interview the driver, who was in hospital under police guard. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews, called the incident an \"evil, deliberate, cowardly act\" that left 19 people hurt -- four of them critically. In a tweet, police appealed to members of the public to upload any images they might have of the incident to help assist with their investigation. A witness, named only as Sue, told Melbourne radio station 3AW that she heard screams and saw \"people flying everywhere\". \"We could hear this noise, as we looked left, we saw this white car, it just mowed everybody down,\" she said. \"People are flying everywhere. We heard thump, thump. People are running everywhere.\" Another witness, John, told ABC Radio Melbourne that he saw an \"SUV coming at high speed\". \"(I) really just heard the collision with people with bags and what must be shopping trolleys -- and I hope not prams,\" he said. \"Ive really never seen anything like this before and I havent stopped shaking.\" The intersection is one of Melbournes busiest, a local shop owner told national broadcaster ABC, and is particularly crowded at this time of the year ahead of the Christmas break, with school holidays under way. The incident came after a car mowed down pedestrians in Melbournes busiest mall in January, killing six people. The driver, whose case is still being heard in court, had been pursued by police prior to the rampage after he had allegedly stabbed his brother. Canberra has become increasingly worried about homegrown extremism and officials say they have prevented 13 terror attacks on home soil in the past few years. The Australian government in August unveiled a strategy aimed at preventing vehicle attacks in crowded public places. Suggested steps include deterrent options like fencing and closed circuit cameras, and delaying approaches such as trees and bollards to slow down vehicles. Melbourne has also been installing a public siren system and more security cameras to warn people of a possible terrorist attack or other serious threats. Andrews said there would an inquiry into the incident, and whether any further changes to Melbournes security measures needed to be made. Over the next few days, hundreds more police would patrol the city, he added. While the circumstances surrounding Thursdays incident were still unclear, there have been several cases of vehicles being used to deliberately maim and kill. The most deadly such case was in the southern French city of Nice on July 14, 2016, when 31-year-old Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel ploughed a 19-tonne truck down a beachside promenade, killing 86 people and injuring hundreds more. Other deadly attacks using vehicles have taken place in Berlin, New York, London, Stockholm and Barcelona.','WORLD-REST-OF-WORLD','','2017-12-21 18:09:00','AP | Dec 21, 2017, 18:09 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(716,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/triumphant-trump-celebrates-tax-win-but-some-fear-backlash/articleshow/62188532.cms','Triumphant Trump celebrates tax win — but some fear backlash','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62188533,width-400,resizemode-4/62188533.jpg]','WASHINGTON: A triumphant President Donald Trump and jubilant fellow Republicans celebrated the passage of their $1.5 trillion tax overhaul Wednesday as a \"historic victory for the American people.\" The American people, however, will need some convincing. As Trump and GOP lawmakers gathered at the White House to cheer their first major legislative achievement — and the biggest tax changes in a generation — some Republicans warned that the party could face a painful political backlash against an overhaul that offers corporations and wealthy taxpayers the biggest benefits and triggers the loss of health care coverage for millions of Americans. There was no hint of anxiety at the White House, though, as the president and congressional Republicans pushed any qualms aside and reveled in a much-needed win at the end of a year marked by GOP infighting and political stumbles. \"We are making America great again,\" Trump declared, personally thanking his \"little team\" of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, before lawmakers lavished praise upon a president they have often openly criticized. \"I dont know if well have bigger moments, but we hope to,\" said Trump.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1513780371000 The president was expected to sign the bill at a later date for technical reasons. In fact, the signing may be postponed until the start of the new calendar year in order to delay $120 billion in automatic cuts to popular programs such as Medicare and spare Republicans from having to explain them in an election year. The tax package provides a deep cut in the corporate rate, from 35 percent to 21 percent. On the individual side, about 80 percent of American households will get tax cuts next year, while about 5 percent will pay more, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. People who make less than $25,000 will see an average tax cut of $60; those who earn between $49,000 and $86,000 will get about $900, and those in the top 1 percent of income — earning more than $733,000 — will receive around $51,000 in tax savings, the policy center said. The cuts will come at a price: The Congressional Budget Office predicts the legislation will add $1.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Some of the presidents strongest allies conceded that voters may not immediately warm to the new law. Andy Surabian, a senior aide for a pro-Trump super PAC, likened the presidents position to that of Ronald Reagan, who struggled through low approval ratings early in his presidential term after Congress passed a tax cut that led to huge Republican losses in the 1982 midterm elections. Reagan went on to a sweeping re-election in 1984 after the economy improved. Said Surabian: \"Even if we dont start seeing positive effects in 2018, the important thing here is President Trump sets himself up to win re-election in 2020.\" GOP strategists and candidates alike called on Trump to launch an immediate public relations tour to sell the plan to help avert an anti-Republican tsunami in 2018. \"People dont understand it,\" said Virginia Republican Senate candidate Corey Stewart, though he still called passage \"a massive win\" for Trump and the GOP. Only about 1 in 3 voters have supported the legislation in recent days, according to several polls. About half of Americans believe the plan will hurt their personal finances. And 2 in 3 voters say the wealthy will get the most benefits, according to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll released last week The White House said Wednesday that Trump will actively promote the bill. Aides argued that media coverage has not accurately portrayed the benefits and that people will come around as they feel the payoff. Trump himself complained in a tweet that \"defeated Dems\" and the media were out to \"demean\" the tax package but \"the results will speak for themselves, starting very soon.\" Democrats, who unanimously opposed the tax plan in Congress, were furious about the new policy yet upbeat about the potential political fallout in next years elections. They need to flip 24 House seats and just two Senate seats to take control of each chamber. Asked if the tax bill will help Republicans hold the House, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi leaned into a microphone and said, \"Let. Them. Think. That.\" The bill goes far beyond taxes. While it does not repeal the law known as \"Obamacare,\" the legislation finalized by the House on Wednesday attacks a central tenet of the health care system by eliminating the requirement that all Americans have health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office says elimination of the \"individual mandate\" will boost health care costs by about 10 percent for those with coverage and leave 13 million additional Americans without health insurance in 10 years. Millions of people will still remain covered under the laws Medicaid expansion and health care exchanges, but Trump cast the package as a shadow repeal. \"We have essentially repealed Obamacare,\" the president declared. On taxes, the first modest effects will be felt in February paychecks. People living in high-tax states like New York and California may ultimately pay more. Among those who benefit, the wealthy will make out far better than the working-class voters who fueled Trumps victory last year. Trump said Wednesday the bill will spur economic growth as corporations, flush with cash, increase wages and hire more workers. Democrats questioned, even mocked that prediction. Reflecting the political risks, some of the nations most vulnerable House Republicans voted against the bill. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., one of 12 GOP House members to vote no, said the tax plan would hurt many people in high-tax states. The bill imposes a $10,000 cap on taxpayers who deduct their state, local and property taxes. Currently, there is no limit on how much in state and local taxes you can deduct. All but one of the GOP no votes came from like-minded Republicans facing re-election in 11 months in moderate districts across New Jersey, New York and California. The road to a Democratic House majority, if there is one, runs through these districts. All the salesmanship in the world wont change the reality that the tax overhaul overwhelmingly favors the rich, Democratic critics said. \"People think its unfair. They want tax reform, they dont want tax cuts for the wealthy,\" said Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia. \"And I think people will realize theyve been sold a pig in a poke.\"','WORLD-US','','2017-12-21 09:24:00','AP | Dec 21, 2017, 09:24 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(717,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/un-security-council-imposes-new-sanctions-on-north-korea-over-missile-test/articleshow/62217052.cms','UN Security Council imposes new sanctions on North Korea over missile test','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62217053,width-400,resizemode-4/62217053.jpg]','UNITED NATIONS/SEOUL: The UN Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Friday for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad. The U.N. resolution seeks to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year and, in a last-minute change, demands the repatriation of North Koreans working abroad within 24 months, instead of 12 months as first proposed. The U.S.-drafted resolution also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Council to further reductions if it were to conduct another nuclear test or launch another ICBM. North Korea on Nov. 29 said it successfully tested a new ICBM that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. Tension has been rising over North Koreas nuclear and missile programmes, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House. In November, North Korea demanded a halt to what it called \"brutal sanctions\", saying a round imposed after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 constituted genocide. US diplomats have made clear they are seeking a diplomatic solution but proposed the new, tougher sanctions resolution to ratchet up pressure on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \"It sends the unambiguous message to Pyongyang that further defiance will invite further punishments and isolation,\" Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said after the 15-0 vote. The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wu Haitao, Chinas deputy UN ambassador, said tensions on the Korean peninsula risk \"spiralling out of control\" and he repeated Beijings call for talks. Chinas foreign ministry said it hoped all parties would implement the resolution and urged all sides to exercise restraint. It also reiterated a call for what it calls a \"dual suspension\" proposal for the United States and South Korea to stop major military exercises in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programmes. South Korea welcomed the sanctions and called on the North to \"immediately cease reckless provocations, and take the path of dialogue for denuclearization\". North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, the United States and Japan, and says its weapons are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. On Friday, North Korea called U.S. President Donald Trumps recently released national security strategy the latest attempt to \"stifle our country and turn the entire Korean peninsula\" into an outpost of American hegemony. INCREASING PRESSURE Speaking before the Security Council vote, analysts said the new sanctions could have a major effect on the Norths economy. \"The cap on oil would be devastating for North Koreas haulage industry, for North Koreans who use generators at home or for productive activities, and for (state-owned enterprises) that do the same,\" said Peter Ward, a columnist for NK News, a website that tracks North Korea. The forced repatriation of its overseas workers would also cut off vital sources of foreign currency, he said. China, which supplies most of North Koreas oil, has backed successive rounds of U.N. sanctions but had resisted past U.S. calls to cut off fuel supplies to its neighbour. John Park, director of the Korea Working Group at the Harvard Kennedy School, said it was important to manage expectations about sanctions, which could take years to have a full impact while the North was making progress in its weapons progammes at a pace measured in weeks and months. \"If the game plan is to use sanctions as the last non-military policy tool to induce North Koreas return to the denuclearization table, we may quickly find Washington prioritizing military options,\" Park said. The move to curb Chinese fuel exports to North Korea may have limited impact after China National Petroleum Corp suspended diesel and gasoline sales to its northern neighbour in June over concerns it would not get paid. Business has slowed since then, with zero shipments of diesel, gasoline and other fuel from China in October. Russia quietly boosted economic support for North Korea this year, and last week Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said Moscow was not ready to sign up to sanctions that would strangle the country economically. In a bid to further choke North Koreas external sources of funding, the resolution also seeks to ban North Korean exports of food products, machinery, electrical equipment, earth and stone, wood and vessels. It also bans exports to North Korea of industrial equipment, machinery, transport vehicles, and industrial metals as well as subjecting 15 North Koreans and the Ministry of the Peoples Armed Forces to a global asset freeze and travel ban. The resolution seeks to allow countries to seize, inspect and freeze any vessel they believe was carrying banned cargo or involved in prohibited activities. Even if the sanctions have an economic effect, it is not clear whether that would push Pyongyang to negotiate or stop its weapons development, said Kim Sung-han, a former South Korean vice foreign minister. \"We have had numerous ... sanctions against North Korea over the past 25 years,\" he said. \"Almost none have worked effectively to halt the regimes military and nuclear ambitions.\"','WORLD-US','','2017-12-23 09:15:00','Reuters | Dec 23, 2017, 09:15 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(718,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/rmc-targets-better-spot-on-swacch-list/articleshow/62105272.cms','RMC targets better spot on Swacch list','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62105319,width-400,resizemode-4/62105319.jpg]','RANCHI: Ranchi Municipal Corporation is leaving no stone unturned to secure a better rank at Swachh Survekshan 2018, which scheduled to begin on January 4.

Municipal commissioner Shantanu Kumar Agrahari said, \"We need the participation of the people to help the city get a better rank. We are organising various competitions like Swachh Mohalla, Swachh School, Swachh Hospital and others so to ensure the publics participation.\" The city will be awarded marks out of 4,000 on three parameters - 1,400 each for documentation and citizen feedback and 1,200 for direct observation. The various points covered includes collection and transportation of garbage, processing and disposal, sanitation (including ODF status), capacity building, download of Swachhta app and more. Agrahari said, \"We have been given a target of getting 23,400 Swachhta app downloaded and we have already reached the 20,000-mark. However, just downloading the app is not enough. We would request the citizens to send in their complaints through the app and we will try resolving them within 12 hours. This app is directly monitored by the Centre, so they will monitor our work directly and assess us.\" The city has already been declared open defecation free and the target of toilet construction has been achieved by RMC. However, garbage disposal is a major issue in the city and this could lead to the civic body losing marks as the work has been outsourced to a private company, but nothing has been done yet. \"Because we have already given the work order, we will get 40 out of 60 marks allotted on this ground,\" the municipal commissioner said. The commissioner claimed that the centralised decomposing system is being installed at all the places that generate garbage in bulk and RMC is hoping to score good marks on this aspect. Installation of twin dustbins in commercial areas of the city will also begin soon. \"We have identified 38 commercial areas on 16 roads across the city where twin dustbins will be install at a distance of every 500 mts.

However, the vice-chancellor (VC) Ramesh Kumar Pandey is yet to take a final call on Friday, which is the last working day of the university for the year 2017. Officials have agreed that a delayed election is neither feasible nor practical. \"The university is pre-occupied with the preparations for the National Level Youth Festival in February. Organising the student union elections at this point of time is not expected, but the final decision remains with the VC,\" P Jha, a university official, said. With the preparations for the festival in full swing, a team of officials from the university also paid a visit to the National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology to finalise a venue for the four-day long national event. The decision for the venue will also be made on Friday. The student union elections for the current session was postponed indefinitely due to demands from various student groups with claims on failed registration of over 67,000 students in the university. Since the decision to indefinitely postpone the elections went live, social media platforms have been abuzz with allegations against political youth bodies including ABVP for influencing the delay of the elections due to lack of candidates. Protests against the decision were staged by NSUI and ACS in the past week demanding the suspension of concerned officials. However, the ABVP leaders seem to have assumed a different stance justifying the cancellation. While speaking about the situation, Atal Pandey, a student leader from ABVP said, \"The elections are delayed due to the universitys fault and all classes will be suspended for a longer period in January and February. Even though suspension of elections have dampened our spirits, organising the student union elections now will only create a chaos.\" He added, \"With most students not present on the campus, the whole cause of the election will be lost. There is no point conducting the elections now, but we are waiting for the VC to make the final call.\" The university has been hitting the headlines for its inability to hold student union elections due to one reason or another over the years. Three student union elections have been successfully organised in the six decades of its foundation and the cancellation of yet another one is disheartening to the students. The first election was held in 1987 and the subsequent one in 2007. Though elections were announced twice in 2009 and 2012, unforeseen circumstances led to their cancellation. The university students were only allowed to contest elections after nine years in 2016 under the tenure of Pandey. He has promised to hold student union elections every session but the chances of living up to that promise are cloudy with his retirement which is scheduled in February 2018. Bharat Dubey, a masters degree student, expressed his anguish over the mismanagement of the election procedure in the university. He said, \"The continuous cancellation of elections over the years is disheartening. As students, we also need to assert our needs and demands but that is impossible without a student body in place.\" He added, \"I believe despite the delay and possibly a short tenure of the body, the elections should be held at once so that the students are not deprived of their rights.\"','CITY-RANCHI','','2017-12-22 14:42:00','TNN | Dec 22, 2017, 14:42 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(720,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/2270-degrees-awarded-at-ranchi-college-convocation/articleshow/62217550.cms','2270 degrees awarded at Ranchi College convocation','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62217651,width-400,resizemode-4/62217651.jpg]','RANCHI: Governor Droupadi Murmu on Friday said there is a need to upgrade the language studies in local local languages, including Mundari, Kurmali and Khortha to MA degree from the present bachelors degree.

Singh was speaking in a function organised by Ranchi Smart City Corporation Limited (RSCCL) in the state capital to promote installation of rooftop solar panels at homes in state capital. Jharkhand, which produces just about 30MW of solar power as of now, experiences 300 days of clear skies a year and has the potential to take the figure to 18,000MW. Speaking as the chief guest on the occasion, Singh said fly ash produced during thermal power generation causes large-scale pollution and the government is trying to promote brick-making using fly ash, as advocated by Union minister Nitin Gadkari. Singh said power generation through solar panels and other renewable sources would also save the governments money. He said Jharkhand requires 2,200MW power, but generates only around 570MW and the state government purchases the required power from other agencies at a high price. Singh said the Centre held a meeting with the state governments this month in which solar energy and other issues, including reducing transmission loss to 15%, were discussed. He said Jharkhand has reduced its transmission loss from 46% to 29%.

They met principal secretary to chief minister Sanjay Kumar and handed over a detailed memorandum underlining the need for starting mental health education programme for children from the state by including a paper in school curriculum. Both the psychiatrists, who have individually catered to several hundred patients from rural parts as well believe that a large number of societal problems could be solved if the family is aware of mental problems and ready to seek medical attention. \"There are cases of witchcraft, superstitious beliefs in black magic and sorcerers and suffering among the poor tribal families because they are unwilling to go to medical centre and learn to live with the disorder,\" Trivedi said. They chose Jharkhand to begin the campaign in the wake of the fact that Ranchi is well known in the Indian map of mental health. \"There could be no better place than Ranchi to start a national campaign and since Raghubar Das government has been the first state in launch of many ambitious programmes we were confident that it could be a big success if started from here,\" Dr Sinha said. In the memorandum the psychiatrists have said,\"Many schools are now appointing counsellors to take care of the mental wellbeing of children. However teachers, too, should be provided training on mental health, to enable them detect early signs of mental illness in children and initiate remedial measures, whenever necessary.\" Psychiatrists believe that if children are taught the difference between superstition and mental disorder from early age they can be the change makers in the family and society as a whole. \"Once children in family have scientific approach to any subject even the parents are forced to change their opinion,\" Sinha said underlining the importance of introducing mental health in curriculum. Sanjay Kumar appreciated the effort and assured to hold talks with the departments of school education and literacy and health and family welfare to chalk out a definitive measure for adoption of the chapters in curriculum. The country wide campaign launched by both the doctors aims at impressing upon chief ministers of all the 29 states of the country to include mental health as part of the school curriculum, within a short span. Dr Sinha said each life lost is a loss to the nation. To raise awareness, root out the stigma surrounding mental illness and save precious lives of students, the initiative was necessary. \"Our children study about drawing diagram of lungs and eyes but they are not told about mind and associated possibility of illness which needs to be addressed soon to make them aware,\" Trivedi said.','CITY-RANCHI','Jaideep Deogharia','2017-12-17 21:58:00','| TNN | Dec 17, 2017, 21:58 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(727,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/bizman-misses-rajdhani-santa-cop-gifts-flight-ticket/articleshow/62118238.cms','Businessman misses Rajdhani, Santa cop gifts flight ticket','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62118236,width-400,resizemode-4/62118236.jpg]','Bizman misses Rajdhani, Santa cop gifts flight ticket JAMSHEDPUR/RANCHI: Ever missed a train journey after being stuck in the citys serpentine traffic jam? If you do, try calling up the senior superintendent of police (SSP) and you might just get a flight ticket to your destination, for free. Called it his lucky day or a kind act of the Ranchi traffic police department as the festive day of Christmas draws near, Vinay Mishra, who was very upset on missing his Ranchi-New Delhi Rajdhani train to the national capital for a very important business meeting, took up the matter with the departments head, holding him and his constabulary responsible for the traffic mess. In a matter of minutes, the SSP played Santa and booked an air ticket to New Delhi for Mishra, well in time for his business meeting. Recently, chief minister Raghubar Das, who himself got stuck in traffic, ordered a series measures for smooth vehicle movement on the city roads. Mishra, who stayed at a hotel in Mohrabadi, left for the railway station in Ranchi one hour before the scheduled departure of the train on Saturday at 5.55pm. However, his cab got stuck in heavy traffic for about half an hour at Karbala Chowk, under the Lower Bazaar police station area. By the time he reached the station, which is only 4.5km from the chowk, the train has already left. An upset Mishra then made a phone call to Ranchi SP (traffic) Sanjay Ranjan Singh and tried to have a word with him about his grievance. \"I wanted to tell the traffic SP about the woes I experienced because to the traffic jam. I was stuck there for more than 25 minutes and I held him and the traffic cops accountable for the chaos,\" Mishra said. He further said, \"Instead of giving me a patient hearing, the SP interrupted me and told me that I was traveling on a wrong street for which the taxi got caught in the jam.\" According to Mishra, the SP told him that the weekly haat on Karbala road often lead to traffic jams and that he could do little to address his grievance. \"When Mishra called me, I told him that he should have planned his journey with some extra time in hand. After all, traffic is unpredictable in the city,\" Singh told TOI on Sunday. Angered by Singhs response, Vinay went to the Government Railway Police (GRP) at the railway station to lodge an FIR against the SP (traffic) but was told that he should lodge the complaint at the Lower Bazar police station. On reaching the police station, Mishra was trying to lodge the FIR when the station officials informed the SSP of Ranchi, Kuldeep Dwivedi, about the grievance. \"The SSP spoke to me over the phone and told me that I am free to take up the legal recourse but also asked me what he could do to help,\" Mishra said. When Mishra told the SSP that he had to reach Delhi for an urgent work, Diwedi advised him to wait for few minutes. \"In a short while, a Lower Bazaar police official told me that an air ticket on Indigo airlines has been booked for me on Sunday and I was advised to stay overnight in the state capital,\" Mishra said. After reaching Delhi by the Indigo flight on Sunday, Mishra thanked Ranchi police for their good gesture. Later, Lower Bazaar police station in-charge Suman Kumar Sinha told TOI that the air ticket was given to Mishra and the matter was settled amicably. \"The commuter also realized that pursing legal action will further consume his time, hence he retracted from his previous position and agreed to fly to Delhi the next morning,\" Sinha added. Talking about the incident, Ranchi SSP Kuldeep Dwivedi said, \"He called me at night saying that he missed his train due to traffic jam and wants to take action against the traffic SP. I made it clear to him that we dont agree with this and dont buy his argument. But at the same time we understand his anguish.\"','CITY-RANCHI','B Sridhar and Kelly Kislaya','2017-12-18 15:18:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 18, 2017, 15:18 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(728,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/maoist-ideologue-ghandy-arrested-by-jharkhand-police/articleshow/62111298.cms','Maoist ideologue Ghandy arrested by Jharkhand police','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62111297,width-400,resizemode-4/62111297.jpg]','BOKARO: Maoist ideologue Kobad Ghandy was arrested by Jharkhand Police from Hyderabad in connection with two Naxal-related violence cases, a senior police officer said on Sunday.

Rane stated that GMCs dean and the medical superintendent \"have been given discretionary powers to exempt poor patients\". Earlier, Rane had declared that starting December 1, all outstation patients would be charged. The decision, however, was deferred as the infrastructure was not ready. \"Counters have been set up, and the hospital administration is ready to bill patients from outside the state,\" Rane said. While stating that the \"20% rate fixed for category C hospitals is low, \"he pointed out that GMC is classified as a category A hospital.

Parrikars letter comes a day after BJP national president Amit Shah held a meeting in Delhi between Karnataka party leaders and the Goa chief minister and is in response to Yeddyurappas request to utilise 7.56TMC of water from the Mhadei for drinking purposes in the drought-prone areas of north Karnataka. \"We will not compromise Goas interest,\" Parrikar told reporters. Parrikar said he has not agreed to give water, but only decided \"in principle\" that Goa \"would not oppose reasonable and justified quantum of water meant to be utilised for drinking\", provided there is a monitoring mechanism in place, and is ready to hold bilateral talks with Karnataka. He said drinking water supply was one of the issues pending before the Mhadei Water Dispute Tribunal, but it needs to be discussed bilaterally as suggested by it. \"There is no timeline set for talks,\" he said. He also dismissed suggestions that there was pressure from Shah and said the meeting was scheduled in advance. \"As the party president, it is his right to organise the meeting,\" Parrikar said. He said Goa considering Karnatakas request would not change the states stance at the tribunal. \"It is needless to mention that the discussion shall be without prejudice to our rights and contentions before the tribunal, none of which are even touched by this letter. I appreciate your concern over the drinking water issues of the people and assure to extend the best possible cooperation in the matter,\" Parrikar wrote, which was marked \"Without Prejudice\". Parrikar said once the bilateral agreement is worked out between the two states, then it would be placed before the tribunal. He said in 2002, the national water commission had given a unilateral letter to Karnataka to take drinking water, which was objected by Goa. \"We told them that if they require drinking water, then we can have bilateral talks and work out a control mechanism and come out with a solution,\" Parrikar said, adding Karnataka cannot divert water as per their wish. He also said he had objected to the construction of canal to divert the Mhadei water, as water in the canal cannot be measured. When asked whether this can be considered as out-of-court settlement, Parrikar said: \"I have taken approval from senior counsel and additional solicitor general of India Atmaram Nadkarni and he has made it very clear that two points—without prejudice and nothing said in this letter will consider even touch the tribunal issue (shows that we are not going for an out-of-court settlement),\" Parrikar said. He said there is no infirmity when it comes to the legal issue. \"When we consider the release of water to Karnataka, we will consider 100 liters of water per person.

A meeting with BJP chief Amit Shah, Karnataka party chief B S Yeddyurappa and other leaders in Delhi on Wednesday appears to have softened Parrikar on the tricky water-sharing issue. Environmentalists had ruled out a solution through dialogue. Parrikar himself has been firm over obtaining a courtruled decision in the matter. The BJP-led government, during his tenure as chief minister in 2002, had petitioned the central government to set up the Mahadayi Water Dispute Tribunal (MWDT). In the 1990s, Karnataka had initiated hydrological surveys in the Mahadayi basin in its border areas, and set up infrastructure which convinced Goa that it was serious about diversion. Goa had challenged before the MWDT the proposed damming and diversion of Mahadayi and its tributaries. The tribunal was set up in 2002 after the Congress government in Goa, during then water resources minister Dayanand Narvekars tenure in the late 1990s, came close to sharing 7.56tmcft of water from the Mahadayi tributaries with Karnataka. For this reason, the Parrikar-led governments challenge before the tribunal was viewed as an initiative to checkmate water-sharing. Environmentalists were wary of the tribunal route to resolving the issue, arguing that it invariably concludes disputes with a water-sharing formula. But the Mahadayi affair has put Karnataka on the backfoot, necessitating agitations and appeals to the Centre for an out-of-court settlement. Parrikar, and even his predecessor Laxmikant Parsekar, wisely avoided negotiations with Karnataka. Parsekar, at one stage, agreed to talks with his counterpart, but deftly avoided attending the meeting. \"The dispute is not between political parties or a matter of only central BJP and Goa/Karnataka BJP, but concerns all political parties and people of Goa. Future generations may face a real water supply crisis,\" Nandkumar Kamat, a former government-appointed expert panel member on Mahadayi diversion said. In a remark contrary to the BJP governments general stand, water resources minister Vinod Paliencar had said Goa was willing to hold talks with Karnataka, but later withdrew the remark. During the monsoon session in August 2017, Parrikar had, while addressing concerns raised by senior Congress leader Pratapsinh Rane, commented that Karnataka was picking fights with all states over water. On Thursday, after Parrikar expressed his willingness to holds talks with Karnataka, Rane said: \"You have to be careful what you do with Karnataka. We cannot allow them to take water. If at all we give them, then they have to pay for use. We cannot allow them to take water from catchment areas.

Its not Pune City; not hosts FC Goa either. With so much of attacking talent at either end, its unlikely to be a draw as well. There will be goals, surely, but according to the Brazilian striker who finished as the Golden Boot winner in last seasons Indian Super League (ISL), the crowd will walk out as winners. \"This one is going to be a very competitive match. There are quick (attacking) players in both teams and the game, I am sure, will be fast with action at both ends. Who will win? I think the winner will be the crowd,\" Marcelinho told TOI at the team hotel on Thursday. Marcelinho was an unknown commodity in last seasons ISL has he landed here from Atromitos in Greece and took Delhi Dynamos on the doorstep of their first final appearance. He finished as the Golden Boot winner, having netted on 10 occasions while also pitching in with five assists. This time around, all defenders eyes are centred around the Brazilian, making it difficult for him to get past them. \"Thats the reality,\" said Marcelinho, who has scored twice in five matches and sat out of the last match against Bengaluru FC after spending the previous night in hospital. \"Last year, nobody knew me. This year, teams take the field with a defensive strategy for me and it becomes difficult for me (to score). But I can deal with this. I need to counter this strategy. Sometimes I will score, and in other games I wont, but I will always give my best for the team,\" said the Brazilian. Pune City appear a top-heavy team this season with Marcelinho and Uruguayan striker Emiliano Alfaro leading the attack. As evident from the 10 goals they have conceded, their defence has remained suspect. Buts its a strong midfield general - like Florent Malouda at Delhi last season - that Pune have missed the most. \"Playing with Alfaro is good and easy. His movements make it easy for us, but its difficult when you dont have a midfielder like Malouda.

The former finalists are at the top of the table with a match in hand and have looked the most dangerous side. Their 18 goals from five matches have inspired fear within the opposition, but star man Lanzarote feels its too early to label FC Goa as favourites or dismiss others in the race. \"You cant call us successful because we have played just five games. I think the team is on the path to success but to be successful, we have to improve defensively. Not just as a defensive unit but as a collective group. Once we do that, we will only get better,\" said Lanzarote, the best paid player in the team. Lanzarote has struck a delightful partnership with fellow Spanish striker Ferran Corominas and scored 13 of FC Goas 18 goals. The strong Spanish influence in the squad - which includes defensive midfielder Eduardo Bedia, besides of course coach Sergio Lobera - is there for all to see and Lanzarote believes their previous spells together has done the trick. \"Coro is someone who I played with for a very long time through the age divisions at Espanyol. I played with Edu last year at Real Zaragoza. I know them quite well. When you know each others game and movement, it makes it a lot easier,\" he said. Lanzarote and Coro in particular have been on fire upfront as FC Goa scored 14 goals in the last three matches. The Spanish star, though, warned everyone not to expect such high scores every time they take the field. \"We cannot be expected to score five goals in every game. When teams face us the next time, they will close us a bit and make it difficult. Their aim will be to stop us from scoring, rather than score against us. Those games will be tight and we need to improve,\" he said.','CITY-GOA','Marcus Mergulhao','2017-12-23 07:24:00','| Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 07:24 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(740,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cong-river-water-being-sacrificed-for-bjps-gains/articleshow/62214738.cms','Congress: River water being sacrificed for BJP’s gains','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62216346,width-400,resizemode-4/62216346.jpg]','PANAJI: Coming down heavily on the Manohar Parrikar-led government for bowing to pressure from BJP national president Amit Shah, and for agreeing to talk to Karnataka on the Mhadei water diversion issue, the Congress said Parrikar had betrayed Goans by considering Karnatakas demand to divert water under the pretext of drinking purposes. State Congress president Shantaram Naik said if Karnataka was allowed 7.56 TMC ft of water from the Mhadei basin, there would be a severe impact on River Mandovi. \"Why do you need talks with Karnataka if our stand that Goa is opposed to give any water to Karnataka is consistent?\" Naik said. \"The agreement may appear to be an interim compromise but in reality, Parrikar is going to sign a final compromise agreement to the detriment of Goas interest.\" Curtorim legislator Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco warned that if the state government agreed to Karnatakas demand to divert water from the Mhadei basin, the Congress would launch an agitation. \"Goa does not have sufficient water,\" Lourenco said. \"We are not taking this lightly.

Encouraged by the appreciation, Imsong is now sharing her knowledge of solid waste management with school students in Varanasi and teaching them how to make compost. It all began when she attended a workshop in IIT-G on solid waste management after which she tried her hand at making compost at home. \"At first I tried it at home — I started a kitchen garden and the process became very easy for me after some time.

In an interview with Chandrima Banerjee and Amava Bhattacharya, he shares his thoughts on Congress, BJP and everything in between. On the upcoming assembly election At any point of time, there is a risk of complacency creeping in. But when you know the opposition is working overtime to dethrone you, it infuses more energy in your campaign, makes you more vigilant. It makes you more committed and more aggressive. On BJP BJP doesnt have its own agenda. It is only implementing the agenda of RSS. That is why RSS is going out of its way to ensure BJP gets all states, by hook or by crook. Why do they need all the states? It is not because of development. It is because they need the Rajya Sabha. Why do they need the Rajya Sabha? Because they want to amend the Constitution. What kind of amendments do they want? The ones that comply with RSSs agenda. I am afraid it will disintegrate the nation. BJP is targeting ready-made leaders here. It is not like they have their own leader whom they can groom and expect to win. They are looking at potential sitting MLAs who can be roped in and projected as their candidate. BJP will do everything it can to win. Their leaders will stoop to any extent. So we need to insulate ourselves. On factionalism within Congress We could have done well in Tripura had it not been for dissent within the party. The problem with Congress is that we fight among ourselves when we are in power, and even when we are not in power. People get impatient, too. Biren (Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh who switched from Congress to BJP before that states polls) managed to take advantage of the situation in Manipur. Himanta (Biswa Sarma) did the same in Assam. He was eyeing the chief ministers post. Had he stayed on in Congress, his patience would have paid off. On Meghalaya springing a Biren or Himanta We have already taken care of the problem. On the strengths of his campaign Meghalaya has taken great strides in the past seven years. Earlier, violence had gripped peoples lives. Travel advisories would urge people to stay away. All of that has changed. Now, if you dont book a hotel room in advance, you wont get a place to stay in Shillong. People have become more prosperous. Security is freedom. On whom he sees as his rival this election The NPP-BJP combine. The dissidents are all in NPP, which is like saying they are in BJP. The parties have not joined hands openly but there is a strategy in place and it is our job to expose it. The NPPs resources depend on BJP. It is a bankrupt party. So where are its funds coming from? On Rahul Gandhi and Congress in NE The party will give us all support. We will look at minimum rallies, maximum penetration. We will tell people to compare the past and the present, and to look at the future. We will invite our party president here. The Congress will eventually have more than the two states it currently governs (Meghalaya and Mizoram). On women and winnability We have allowed women to participate, given them space. But we will not give tickets to women at the cost of winnability. Winning every seat is important. So we are looking at pragmatic politics. On vikaas We have demonstrated development on the ground in Meghalaya. Shillong is much more prosperous now. Tourists going to other destinations in the state do not even have to enter Shillong. Besides, we have invested in the education and the social sectors. We have approved funds for expansion of the Umroi airport. We are going ahead with the expansion of the Baljek airfield as well. We have been able to set a new benchmark for governance.

The road show was part of a series of initiatives to reach out to investors and industrialists from across India and abroad to ensure maximum participation in the first ever global investors summit, which will be held in Assam in February. Addressing more than 300 business leaders, the chief minister spoke about the business landscape in Assam — focussing on ease of doing business, single window clearance system, skilled workforce and the states abundant natural resources. The governments thrust on reviving growth and investment cycles is already reaping benefits, Sonowal said, citing the Rs 6,500-crore investment his government brought to the state in its first year in office. \"Entrepreneurship is given a big boost in the state. New policies for supporting young entrepreneurs have been put in place. Skill development institutes and incubation centres for aspiring entrepreneurs in partnership with foreign nations are being set up,\" he added. Assam hopes to host a large number of international business delegations apart from domestic investors during the summit. Around 2,000 industry leaders and representatives are expected to attend the meet. At the curtain-raiser for the summit, Sonowal had said Assam holds a lot of untapped potential. \"Assam is no more a land of extremism.

Several governments at the Centre and in the state have been unable to settle on an absolute number of illegal migrants from Bangladesh - an inflammatory issue in the state. This is largely due to the lack of any effort to carry out a scientific enumeration of the population. With the first draft of the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC), compiled after a lengthy and contentious process, the scenario will finally be clear. \"We are coming out with the first draft, which will be displayed at all NRC seva kendras immediately past midnight of December 31. I will stand by the findings, but cant divulge the numbers now,\" state coordinator of the NRC update process Prateek Hajela said. The Supreme Court, which is supervising the update process, had set a December 31 midnight deadline for the publication of the first draft. The last NRC was compiled in 1951 and had recorded the presence of 80 lakh Indians in the state. Since then, the debate has revolved around everything from the process to identify citizens to the cut-off date for determining citizens. The process of updating the NRC with the sole objective of the filtering out the unknown number of illegal migrants from the state was notified by the Registrar General of India in March, 2010. The first part of draft containing the names of the Indian citizens from among 2.38 crore of the states 3.14-crore population, whose citizenship claims have been verified so far, 11 days from now. The second draft will be prepared after further verification of the remaining 47 lakh persons, whose parental linkage is doubtful, and 29 lakh married women whose panchayat certificates have been declared valid recently by the apex court. \"The apex court is likely to give a time frame for the second draft,\" Hajela said. The publication of the first draft now raises another question - what would the government do with the illegal foreigners who are identified? India does not have any treaty with Bangladesh to send back its citizens. \"India cant deport any illegal Bangladeshi foreigner to Bangladesh because we dont have any treaty with the country. Sometimes, we try to push them across the border, but covertly. Now, we are keeping them in detention camps after the foreigner tribunals declare them as illegal foreigners,\" a home department official said. Hajela made it clear that the illegal migrants issue is beyond his domain. \"My mandate is only to list the names of Indian citizens,\" he said.','CITY-GUWAHATI','Prabin Kalita','2017-12-21 13:05:00','| TNN | Dec 21, 2017, 13:05 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(754,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/sonowal-election-mandate-reflects-peoples-faith-in-modi/articleshow/62128065.cms','Sonowal: Election mandate reflects people’s faith in Modi','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62128064,width-400,resizemode-4/62128064.jpg]','GUWAHATI: Having retained Gujarat yet again and displacing the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh, mood in the BJP camp was upbeat on Monday. \"The results in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh prove that people are happy and secure under Prime Minister Modis leadership.

In its statement before the arbitrator, the civic body listed its losses under 13 different heads and pegged the loss at Rs259.85 crore. TOI has already reported that VNIL had caused NMC a loss of Rs541 crore. In its arbitration notice served to the NMC, the VNIL alleged that the civic body did not pay Rs94 crore towards students concession. VNIL added that Rs244 crore loss was incurred due to lack of infrastructure, Rs88 crore due to NMCs failure to act against illegal passenger vehicles and Rs15.50 crore due to lack of revision in fares despite hike in fuel prices. Rejecting VNILs claim, the NMC has also revised the rent of three lands provided to the earlier city bus operator in its arbitration notice. Earlier, the NMC had provided these lands at a nominal rent. But now it has imposed the rent as per ready reckoner value of the properties. The defaulting rent, as per the new calculation, stands at Rs125 crore. The other heads under which VNIL had defaulted on the payments included Rs15.50 crore royalty, Rs3.90 crore share towards Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, Rs1.30 crore rent for using platforms at Mor Bhavan, Rs68 crore towards depreciation of buses costs, Rs19 crore and Rs6 crore outstanding were towards passengers tax and children nutrition fund, respectively. The NMC has also slapped notice for recovery of Rs5.50 crore towards repairs of JNNURM buses. It also showed a loss of Rs35 crore in advertisement revenues.

Stating that the NMC did not give any positive response towards the demand of arbitration, the VNIL had also filed a petition in the high court on January 17.

While stubble burning in neighbouring states is one of the main source of air pollution in Delhi, for cities of Maharashtra it is vehicular pollution. Yet, most of them still have much cleaner air when compared to Northern India. A conversation with P Anbalagan, member secretary of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), unwrapped this and many other facts relating to pollution. On states air quality By and large, Maharashtra is doing well as far as nitrogen and sulphur oxides are concerned. However, at some places in Pune and Mumbai, particularly in Bandra, nitrogen oxide is an issue mainly due to traffic congestions. If the problem of traffic is not handled, other cities like Nagpur too might start facing same problems. Most of the cities in the state are non-conforming to standard parameters when it comes to particulate matter (PM). On reasons for high PM The apportionment goes with vehicular air pollution being at the top, followed by construction activities and industries. Domestic cooking is also an issue. On tackling vehicular pollution Sadly, traffic flow is not taken as a pollution issue but more as a comfort issue. We dont realize the amount of toxic pollutants which are emitted when traffic is held-up. It is time we go for good flyovers, traffic junctions and switch to public transport. Also, the Pollution Under Control Certificates (PUC) of vehicles should be monitored in a more professional way. Random checks should be carried out. Automobile authorities, transport department along with pollution control board should set a benchmark for scrapping the vehicles. On roads & pollution In any Indian city, road dust alone contributes to 15-20% in the rise in particulate matter. When going for cement roads, good green coverage should be a priority. A lot of parallel plantation is needed for carbon fixing. Also, the dust needs to be absorbed and trees help significantly in that. Constructing small fountains can also help. On indoor air pollution It is a problem and we cannot dispense it. The main causes of indoor air pollution is mosquito coils, incense sticks, LPG and campfires. These factors increase the concentration of particulate matter manifold. Burning Neem leaves, wood and other waste also leads to high quantum of PM. Every house must have an exhaust. On temperature and pollution When temperature gets down, the particles become heavier and their movement gets trapped. When combined with low winds particularly during the beginning and middle of winters, the dispersion levels of pollutants gets lower. So, there is a relative effect of temperature and wind on air pollution. On MPCBs action plan With expert institutions, we are coming up with an action plan for 10 cities which will incorporate graded response. This means that when a pollutant will suddenly increase due to meteorological issues, we will have a standard operating procedure to tackle it. Also, ours is the only state which is conducting large-scale noise-mapping in 27 cities along with the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute.','CITY-NAGPUR','Manka Behl','2017-12-23 12:48:00','| tnn | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 12:48 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(764,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/those-jailed-during-emergency-to-get-pension-says-cm/articleshow/62214579.cms','Those jailed during Emergency to get pension, says CM','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62219049,width-400,resizemode-4/62219049.jpg]','NAGPUR: The state government is considering according status of freedom fighter and provide pension and other facilities to those who were jailed or detained during Emergency between 1975-1977.

With the latest entrant, there will be four tigers in Gorewada. The five-year-old male had entered Bhandara forest territory on December 10 after attending a wedding and housewarming ceremony in Masulkhapa village in MP bordering Maharashtra. The tiger was pushed to Bhandara side by foresters and infuriated villagers. \"In the last 12 days of my monitoring, the tiger, though did not attack any humans, barring a mock attack on Sundartola woman, showed abnormal behaviour and was coming too close to human settlements and preyed on domestic animals,\" says Shahid Parvez Khan of Save Ecosystem & Tiger (SEAT), Bhandara. The best part of the Fridays operation was that the beast was darted by local teams led by a woman wildlife vet from NGO Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) Disha Sharma within 12 hours of chief wildlife warden issuing orders. \"The spot was unfriendly and there was no visibility beyond 5 feet. This may be perhaps first case of darting a tiger in the wild by a woman vet,\" said ACF PG Kodape. According to officials, the tiger had killed a calf on Thursday from Sitasawangi village in dense lantana bushes. When the team learnt about it, they tracked the tiger and a plan was chalked out. The operation was launched at 11am on Friday and by 3pm, the tiger was caged and sent to the rescue centre here. Due to hostile spot and lack of elephants, two JCB machines were pressed into service to track the tiger. As the animal approached the kill, Dr Sharma shot a dart from 15 feet but the tiger continued to walk. Later, second dart was shot by Navegaon-Nagzira Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) men. Still the tiger eluded the teams. After the third dart was shot by Dr Sharma, the big cat ell and was lifted in a nylon net. Police personnel managed to keep a mob of at least 5,000 villagers at bay but lost control over people when the news of tiger being trapped spread. People did not allow the vehicle to go until they saw the tiger themselves. Bhandara deputy conservator Vivek Hoshing said there is a wart between the eyes and nose of the tiger and only wildlife vets will be able to tell whether this had anything to do with its abnormal behaviour and health. The decision to re-release the tiger will be taken by the PCCF (wildlife). However, wildlife vet Dr Vinod Dhoot, who examined the tiger, says wart has nothing to do with abnormal behaviour and food consumption. \"Its psychology needs to be studied,\" he feels. When asked, PCCF (wildlife) AK Misra said, \"I cant comment about the rehabilitation of the tiger now. Reports state that the big cat showed abnormal behaviour but all will depend on vets certification.\" Misra added next week a committee of wildlife officials, experts and those who closely monitored the tiger in the last 12 days will be constituted. \"Any decision to relocate the tiger will depend on the committee report. Im still unable to understand why the tiger chose to visit only villages and came close to people without any fear, despite good forest there,\" he added.','CITY-NAGPUR','Vijay Pinjarkar','2017-12-23 13:19:00','| tnn | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 13:19 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:00'),(766,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/tiny-tots-seek-blessings-of-mothers-at-bal-jagat/articleshow/62214586.cms','Tiny tots seek blessings of mothers at Bal Jagat','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62214585,width-400,resizemode-4/62214585.jpg]','Nagpur: Love children have for their mother was seen in abundance at Matrudin event, organized by Deendayal Shodh Sanstha at Bal Jagat, Laxmi Nagar, on Thursday.

Beginning with the evening Ganga Aarti the night-cycle completes with the morning aarti before the day break. \"It is the blessings of Maa Ganga and Bhagwan Vishwanath that people come here not only to spend some quality time but also to explore their inner self in the proximity of the holy river,\" said Pt Kishori Raman Dubey, commonly known as Babu Maharaj, the founder of Gangotri Seva Samiti that has been holding Ganga aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat for last two decades. It seems that the ghats of Varanasi never sleep. It was around 11:30 at night, when two youths were busy preparing food for the fishes at an elevated stone platform at Dashashwamed ghat. Completely engrossed in making thin rolls and small balls of atta (wheat flour) by mixing water, they were feeding fishes throwing flour balls into the river. \"Shauk se machhliyon ko khilate hain,\" (It is our hobby to feed the fishes), said one of them Neeraj Gupta without raising his head when asked about their late night venture on the ghat. Feeding fishes or releasing them into the river is a common sight even in day time. The belief behind such practice is that it would protect ones family from all evils. For an elderly resident of Madanpura locality Mehmood Zamal, who normally releases fishes in morning hours, said releasing fishes into the river or feeding them gives peace of mind. He believes that the fishes take away all troubles with them. As the crowd starts returning homes from the ghats after Ganga aarti, serenity prevails all along the riverfront. There is no boat ride, no hustle bustle of pilgrims and tourists as the night progresses. But, if one wants to have some light food around midnight at the ghat steps, the vendors selling South Indian Idli or Banarasi chaat are there at their service. \"I remain here till the people keep on coming (for idli),\" said an idli vendor sitting on one of the wooden chaukis (platform) with the ready stock of edibles. Next to him was a chaat wala looking for customers. \"Though there is no crowd in late night hours, the ghats still remain live with the arrival of local nemi (regular bathers) at around 3 am for bathing,\" said Manish Dubey, son of Babu Maharaj who lives at Dashashwamedh Ghat. During special occasions or festivals people throng the ghats in large numbers for holy bath since midnight, he said. The famous cremation ghats like Manikarnika and Harishchandra also remain live whole night. \"The flames of Manikarnika ghat never die,\" said a local resident Gulshan Kapoor. Besides the ghats, the old city areas like Chowk, Godowlia along the the road leading to the Dashashwamedh Ghat and Cantt railway station area remain buzzing with activities night long. \"The city, particularly its ghat and old city areas never sleep,\" said a professor of sociology at Agrasen PG College Brijesh Pandey','CITY-VARANASI','Binay Singh','2017-12-23 11:40:00','| TNN | Dec 23, 2017, 11:40 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:01'),(780,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/vietnam-national-dies-of-cardiac-arrest-at-varanasi-airport/articleshow/62137313.cms','Vietnam national dies of cardiac arrest at Varanasi airport','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62139680,width-400,resizemode-4/62139680.jpg]','VARANASI: A Vietnam national died of cardiac arrest right before boarding his flight at LBS International airport to return home via Kolkata on Tuesday.

President of Porbandar Fishermen Association Bharat Modi said, \"All the boats — Shubh Laxmi, Hiravatu, Sagar Samrat, Devraj and Sitara — belong to Porbandar, while 30 fishermen are natives of Diu and Vanakbori.\" He said there is a possibility that number of fishermen will increase once the PMSF reaches Karachi coast. \"The information that we got was from was from other fishermen in the sea. Once the boats reach Karachi, our counterparts there will give us the exact figure,\" Modi said. Last week PMSF had abducted 43 fishermen along with seven boats while they were fishing near the IMBL. Last month, too, at least 30 Gujarat fishermen along with their five boats were abducted by PMSF from near Jakhau coast. About 68 fishermen were abducted in October. Since the beginning of 2017, over 500 fishermen with over 70 boats have been apprehended by the Pakistan agency from near IMBL. On Thursday, Pakistan had announced that they will release 291 Indian fishermen in two batches from next week. The first batch would be released on December 29, while the second one will be released on January 8. They will reach India via Waghah border. Fishermen from Porbandar, Mangrol and Veraval often complain that because of water pollution they dont get a big catch nearby. Therefore, they are forced to go deep inside the Arabian Sea. Sometimes, they cross the imaginary IMBL and are apprehended by the PMSF.','CITY-RAJKOT','','2017-12-23 06:32:00','TNN | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 06:32 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:01'),(793,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/three-die-in-two-suicide-bids/articleshow/62199679.cms','Three die in two suicide bids','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62205619,width-400,resizemode-4/62205619.jpg]','RAJKOT: Three persons, including two women and the former sarpanch of a village, committed suicide in two separate incidents reported from Padadhari and Kotada Sangani talukas of Rajkot district in the past 24 hours.

A Russia-backed insurgency erupted in 2014 and the bloodshed has continued despite a ceasefire deal that was meant to end a conflict in which more than 10,000 people have been killed, with casualties reported on a near-daily basis. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitors the implementation of the peace agreement, said it had recorded 16,000 ceasefire violations between December 11 and December 17, a 35 percent increase on the week before. \"We note with concern a sharp deterioration in the security situation with ceasefire violations reaching levels not recorded since February this year,\"chief monitor Ertugrul Apakan said in a statement. In February, a surge of violence around the government-held industrial town of Avdiivka cut off power and water to thousands of civilians on the front line. Apakan said the latest escalation reflected an established trend \"in which a recommitment to the ceasefire by the sides was followed by a steady increase in the level of violence, culminating in fierce fighting\". Apakans comments followed warnings from aid agencies over the humanitarian situation in the eastern Donbass region, particularly given Mondays attack on the government-controlled village of Novoluhanske. The United Nations OCHA humanitarian arm said on Twitter heavy shelling near Novoluhanske was affecting 2,000 residents. People are fleeing the area in blizzard conditions, it said. Eight civilians were wounded and more than 50 buildings were damaged in the shelling, which also temporarily cut power supplies, the regional Kiev-controlled Donetsk administration said. A Reuters witness saw residents picking their way through the rubble of destroyed homes and surveying fire-blackened buildings. The US State Department said the humanitarian situation was \"dire\"because of the shelling, which it blamed on Russian-led forces firing Grad multiple-launch rockets. The Ukrainian military on Tuesday accused pro-Russian separatists of deliberately firing more than 40 times from multiple-launch rocket systems at Novoluhanske. Meanwhile, the rebel command said attacks from the Ukrainian side had almost doubled in the past 24 hours, according to separatist news website DAN. Rebels deny attacking Novoluhanske and say the Ukrainian military fired at the village to justify their attacks on separatist-held civilian areas, according to DAN. The US State Department also voiced concern about fighting around the Donetsk water filtration station, which has a system of pipes that carry chlorine gas. \"If those were to go off in this area, which is close to where people live, it could be potentially devastating,\"State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing. She said civilian water workers were trapped in the stations bomb shelter and could not get out because of fighting. In an effort to end the deadlock, the international community, including the United States, has in recent months been advocating for the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in the Donbass. Both Kiev and Moscow backed the idea but disagree on whether the troops should be positioned on the rebel-controlled part of the Ukraine-Russia border, so no decision was made. Russia denies accusations from Ukraine and NATO that it supports the rebels with troops and weapons.','WORLD-EUROPE','','2017-12-20 13:45:00','Reuters | Dec 20, 2017, 13:45 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:01'),(799,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/catalan-separatists-win-absolute-parliamentary-majority/articleshow/62205855.cms','Catalan separatists win absolute parliamentary majority','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62206505,width-400,resizemode-4/62206505.jpg]','BARCELONA: Catalan separatists won a crucial snap poll on Thursday, plunging their region into further uncertainty after a failed independence bid rattled Europe and triggered Spains worst political crisis in decades. With turnout at a record high and 99.6 percent of the ballots counted, the election handed a mandate back to the regions ousted separatist leaders, even after they campaigned from exile and behind bars. In a clear indicator of the huge gulf over independence afflicting Catalan society, anti-secessionist centrist party Ciudadanos was meanwhile on course to win the biggest individual result with 37 of the 135 seats in the regional parliament. \"Its a strange feeling. We won the majority of seats, but we lost in votes. As such both sides will be able to claim victory,\" 26-year-old doctor and separatist supporter Fran Robles told AFP after the results were announced. \"Its a good reflection of the reality that Catalonia is politically divided,\" he added. But unless the three pro-independence lists fail to clinch a deal to work together in the coming months, they will rule Catalonia with 70 of the 135 seats in parliament -- two less than their previous tally of 72. For Catalans on both sides of the divide the day had been a moment of truth, following weeks of upheaval and protests unseen since democracy was reinstated following the death in 1975 of dictator Francisco Franco. \"This is a result which no one can dispute,\" deposed leader Carles Puigdemont said from self-imposed exile in Belgium, as he celebrated the separatists win. \"The Spanish state was defeated. (Spanish Prime Minister Mariano) Rajoy and his allies lost,\" he told reporters. The Spanish government called the election after it took the unprecedented step of stripping Catalonia of its treasured autonomy in the aftermath of an independence declaration on October 27 that rattled a Europe already shaken by Brexit. At stake was the economy of a region that has seen its tourism sector suffer and more than 3,100 companies -- including the largest banks, utilities and insurers move their legal headquarters out of Catalonia since the referendum. The declaration came weeks after a banned independence referendum on October 1, which saw a police crackdown that sent shockwaves around the world. Rajoy and his conservative cabinet tried to nip the independence movement in the bud, sacking the regional government and dissolving its parliament. In a further obstacle for the separatist cause, the judiciary pressed charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of funds against the secessionist leaders. Puigdemont, who had fled to Belgium where he tried to rally international support for the separatist cause, has not since returned to Spain, where he faces arrest. His Together for Catalonia list nonetheless secured the best result of the three separatist groupings -- in a major upset for Rajoys government. \"Puigdemont president!\" chanted Puigdemonts campaign manager Elsa Artadi at a rally celebrating the result. \"The result we have obtained is heroic, we have won, Mr Rajoy,\" Together for Catalonia candidate Eduard Pujol said. What still remains unclear, however is whether Puigdemont will be renamed president, and if so, whether he will return from Belgium and how he might govern. Unlike Puigdemont, his former deputy Oriol Junqueras and three other separatist leaders stayed behind in Spain, only to be remanded in custody on November 2. They campaigned for votes from exile and behind bars, with Junqueras sending messages to voters in handwritten letters shared on Twitter, a trickle of phonecalls and interviews, and even poems. \"Practically and emotionally, it has been a very difficult election campaign. We didnt have our candidate here, (ousted) president Puigdemont was in exile in Brussels, and number two on the list, Jordi Sanchez, was in prison,\" said Artadi, Puigdemonts Together for Catalonia list campaign manager. Sergi Sebria, spokesman for Junquerass ERC party, said his party had had to face the election \"in the worst conditions, in absolutely unequal conditions, with its candidate in prison until the last day. \"Despite this we have done everything with hope,\" he said, adding that \"a high turnout legitimises the election result.\" Crucially, the pro-independence camp is not expected to attempt another breakaway from Spain but rather try to enter into negotiations with Madrid. Puigdemont said he aimed to win the support of the European Union for his cause, but it has so far backed Rajoy, saying it supports constitutional order, and that it is an internal matter for Spain. The European Commission stressed its stance remained the same regardless of the result of the vote. On the other side of the separatist divide, Ciudadanos candidate Ines Arrimadas saw the glass half full, and celebrated her centrist partys lead in votes. \"The nationalists will never again be able to speak in the name of all Catalonia. We are all Catalonia,\" she said in a speech to supporters after the result.','WORLD-EUROPE','','2017-12-22 13:31:00','AFP | Dec 22, 2017, 13:31 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:01'),(800,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/eu-court-uber-a-taxi-company-not-a-tech-firm/articleshow/62187443.cms','Uber a taxi company, not a tech firm: EU court','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62187446,width-400,resizemode-4/62187446.jpg]','BARCELONA: Ride-hailing service Uber suffered a new blow on Wednesday as the European Unions top court ruled that it should be regulated like a taxi company and not a technology service, a decision that crimps its activities around Europe and could weigh on other app-based companies too. Taxi drivers honked in celebration while Uber which is wrapping up a particularly punishing year sought to play down the ruling on Wednesday by the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice. The decision might only affect its operations in four countries, and the company said it will try to keep expanding in Europe anyway. The decision in theory applies to ride-hailing services around the 28-nation EU. But the ruling leaves it to national governments to decide how and whether to change the way they regulate Uber and similar services, which have expanded rapidly in recent years. But many taxi drivers saw Wednesdays court decision as an important symbolic victory. And some other internet-based businesses fear it could pave the way for other new regulation, as European authorities look for ways to regulate companies that operate online and outside traditional sectors. The decision stems from a complaint by a Barcelona taxi drivers association, which wanted to prevent Uber from setting up in the Spanish city. The taxi drivers said Uber drivers should have authorisations and licenses, and accused the company of engaging in unfair competition. Arguing its case, San Francisco-based Uber said it should be regulated as an information services provider, because it is based on an app that connects drivers to riders. The court said services provided by companies like Uber are \"inherently linked to a transport service\" and therefore must be classified as \"a service in the field of transport\". Uber said the ruling \"will not change things in most EU nations where we already operate under transportation law\". Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania are the only countries where Wednesdays ruling might have a direct impact.','WORLD-EUROPE','','2017-12-21 06:48:00','AP | Dec 21, 2017, 06:48 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:01'),(801,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putin-says-russias-spy-agencies-prevented-60-terror-attacks/articleshow/62183463.cms','Putin says Russias spy agencies prevented 60 terror attacks','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62183488,width-400,resizemode-4/62183488.jpg]','MOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin says Russian security agencies have thwarted 60 terror attacks in the country this year.

The 65,000-tonne ship, hailed as Britains most advanced military vessel and which was only officially commissioned by the queen two weeks ago, has an issue with a shaft seal which was identified during sea trials, the MoD said. \"This is scheduled for repair while she is alongside at Portsmouth,\" a Royal Navy spokesman said. \"It does not prevent her from sailing again and her sea trials programme will not be affected.\" The Sun newspaper reported that the 280-metre (920-foot) warship, the nations future flagship vessel, was letting in 200 litres of water every hour and the fix would cost millions of pounds. A defence source said the navy was aware the ship, which took eight years to build, had an issue when it was handed over by manufacturers and the Sun said the builders would have to foot the repair bill. The Aircraft Carrier Alliance - a consortium including British engineering companies BAE Systems and Babcock , and the UK division of Frances Thales - built the Queen Elizabeth and its sister aircraft carrier, the HMS Prince of Wales, as apart of a 6.2 billion pound project. \"Its normal practice for a volume of work and defect resolution to continue following vessel acceptance,\" BAE Systems said in a statement. \"This will be completed prior to the nations flagship re-commencing her programme at sea in 2018.\" Chris Parry, a former senior Royal Navy officer, said all ships took on water. \"Thats why you have pumps,\" he told Sky News. \"When you get a brand new car not everythings perfect, you have to send it back to the garage to get a few things tweaked. This is exactly in that bracket.\" On Tuesday, parliaments defence committee raised questions about the procurement of the F-35 fighter jets from a consortium led by Lockheed Martin which will eventually operate from the Queen Elizabeth. The committee said there had been an \"unacceptable lack of transparency\" about the programme and the MoD had failed to provide details of the full cost of each aircraft which one newspaper had estimated could be as much as 155 million pounds. \"Our new aircraft carrier is the epitome of British design and dexterity, at the core of our efforts to build an Armed Forces fit for the future,\" British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said at the Queen Elizabeths commissioning.','WORLD-UK','','2017-12-19 15:23:00','Reuters | Dec 19, 2017, 15:23 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:01'),(806,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/defiant-theresa-may-uk-proving-doubters-wrong-on-brexit/articleshow/62106072.cms','Defiant Theresa May: UK proving doubters wrong on Brexit','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62106076,width-400,resizemode-4/62106076.jpg]','LONDON: British Prime Minister Theresa May has said that her government is \"proving the doubters wrong after European Union leaders agreed that Brexit negotiations can finally move on to their next phase in the new year.

She told ministers she wanted a \"significantly more ambitious deal\" than the EUs recent trade agreement with Canada - even as the blocs chief negotiator warned any deal would not cover Britains dominant financial services sector. The cabinet meeting came four days after EU leaders approved an interim agreement on the terms of the separation, and agreed to move negotiations on to the next stage. May wants Britain to leave the EUs single market and customs union, but forge a new \"deep and special economic partnership\" with the bloc. \"The prime minister said it was clear what the cabinets objective was - a deal which secures the best possible trading terms with the EU, enables the UK to set rules that are right for our situation and facilitates ambitious third-country trade deals,\" her spokesman said. She ruled out replicating Norways membership of the European Economic Area, saying it would be \"democratically unsustainable, because it would mean automatically adopting all EU rules without influence or a vote\", the spokesman said. Instead, the prime minister said she \"would be seeking a significantly more ambitious deal than the EUs agreement with Canada\". Officials have discussed the so-called \"Canada plus\" option, adding other economic sectors into the agreement. However, the EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned today that any deal would inevitably result in Britains banks and financial companies losing rights to trade across the bloc. \"There is no place\" for financial services, he told The Guardian newspaper. \"There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesnt exist.\" He said this was the consequence of Britains decisions, adding: \"In leaving the single market, they lose the financial services passport.\" May said Britain needed to be \"creative in designing our proposal\", adding that Britain \"would be seeking a bespoke deal\". However, no decisions have yet been taken and further government discussions are due \"early in the New Year\", the spokesman said. Some ministers favour continued alignment with EU rules after Brexit to maintain a close trading relationship, while others say leaving the EU is an opportunity for Britain to forge a new path. Media reports suggest that rival camps are coming to agree on a middle way, where Britain would agree a new trade deal with Brussels but gradually move away from the blocs regulations. The spokesman insisted the cabinet was \"unified\" behind the main principles of Brexit and the deal agreed last week on the financial settlement, expatriate rights and the future of the Irish border.','WORLD-UK','','2017-12-19 22:37:00','AFP | Dec 19, 2017, 22:37 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:01'),(810,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/law-intended-to-smooth-brexit-reaches-key-hurdle/articleshow/62182111.cms','Law intended to smooth Brexit reaches key hurdle','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62182114,width-400,resizemode-4/62182114.jpg]','LONDON: Legislation intended to smooth Britains exit from the European Union moved a step closer to becoming law on Wednesday, as ministers began working out what they want from Brexit. The House of Commons was holding its eighth and final day of detailed scrutiny of the EU Bill on withdrawal, which would formally end Britains membership of the bloc and transfer EU rules into British law, and will vote on key amendments. And Prime Minister Theresa May, who suffered a humiliating defeat by pro-European members of her own Conservative party last week when MPs voted to ensure parliament has the final say on any divorce deal with Brussels, was to appear before a powerful parliamentary committee Wednesday to outline her Brexit plan. But she looks set to avoid a second parliamentary rebellion over plans to enshrine Brexit day in law, by agreeing to another amendment giving some flexibility to move the date -- March 29, 2019 -- if negotiations with the EU go down to the wire. Under pressure from MPs during Wednesdays Prime Ministers Questions, May emphasised that any delay to Britains departure from the EU \"would only be in extremely exceptional circumstances and it would only be for the shortest possible time.\" The so-called committee stage of scrutiny was a test for Mays minority government, which relies on a small pro-Britain Northern Irish party to push through legislation. The bill has two days of further debate by MPs in January, when the rebel amendment could be reviewed, before it goes to the unelected House of Lords for debate. EU leaders last week agreed to open the second stage of Brexit talks, after approving an interim deal on Britains financial settlement, expatriate rights and the Irish border. But they are still unclear about what Britain wants from the future relationship, including the shape of any trade deal. Cabinet ministers held their first detailed discussion on the long-term economic partnership at a meeting on Tuesday, though no negotiating position was finalised, and further talks are expected in early January. Mays spokesman said Tuesday that she had called for \"a deal which secures the best possible trading terms with the EU, enables the UK to set rules that are right for our situation and facilitates ambitious third-country trade deals\". He added that the cabinet agreed on the goal. But Mays ministers are divided over how closely to stick to European regulations after Brexit, with some favouring convergence to secure the best possible trading ties, and others calling for a new approach. On Wednesday, May was to be questioned by the Liaison Committee, made up of the chairmen and chairwomen of parliamentary committees, with Brexit preparations dominating the agenda, according to chairwoman Sarah Wollaston, one of the Tory MPs who rebelled against Mays plans last week. \"Given that this session follows such a significant EU Council meeting and recent events in Parliament, on this occasion we will start with a focus on Brexit negotiations and transitionary arrangements,\" she said. Brussels meanwhile has repeatedly warned Britain that it cannot expect to leave the EUs single market and customs union, and maintain all its benefits. Michel Barnier, the EUs chief Brexit negotiator, said that any deal struck would inevitably result in Britains banks and financial companies losing their rights to trade across the bloc. \"There is no place\" for giving Britains financial services full access to the EU market, he told several newspapers, including The Guardian in Britain. In a speech on Wednesday, Barnier also said that the Brexit transition period, during which the EUs rules will still apply to Britain as it quits, should last from when Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019 until the end of 2020, three months earlier than the two-year timeframe suggested by May. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, said that as long as Britains goals remained vague, competing forces in Mays government could keep together. \"But the real difficulties ahead lie when the British will ask for a special system of regulatory alignment -- they wont get it,\" he said.','WORLD-UK','','2017-12-20 19:46:00','AFP | Dec 20, 2017, 19:46 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:01'),(811,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/engineers-can-help-the-country-in-solving-key-issues-president-kovind/articleshow/62224499.cms','Engineers can help the country in solving key issues: President Kovind','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62224476,width-400,resizemode-4/62224476.jpg]','CHENNAI: President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday said that engineers can play a much larger role in solving key challenges faced by our country such as food, healthcare and environment.

For the rebels, the loss of Aleppo on December 22, 2016 signalled the beginning of the end. Rebels now control only 12 percent of Syrias territory, notably the northwestern province of Idlib where jihadists and Islamist rebels dominate. After a string of defeats, the Islamic State group holds just five percent, including a rural pocket in the east and two neighbourhoods on the outskirts of Damascus. Here is a recap of the gains by President Bashar al-Assads forces over the past year: On January 29, 2017, the army recaptures Wadi Barada, the source of Damascuss mains water supply, after rebels agree to withdraw in exchange for an end to a devastating siege that lasted more than a month. On March 2, the Russian Defence Minister and the Syrian army announce they have recaptured the ancient desert city of Palmyra from IS. The city had changed hands several times. First seized by IS in May 2015, it was retaken by the regime in March 2016 before falling back into jihadist hands in December. In May, regime forces take control of three major Damascus districts: Barzeh, Qabun, and Tishrin. Several thousand civilians and fighters leave the capital and head northwest to rebel-held Idlib. Like Wadi Barada and other towns and villages around Damascus, the three districts return to government control under a so-called \"reconciliation\" deal. Rebels and civilians are granted safe passage to opposition-held territory elsewhere in exchange for an end to siege and bombardment by the army. Inside Damascus, rebels still hold part of the eastern neighbourhood of Jobar. It lies near Eastern Ghouta, a besieged rebel-held district east of the capital. On May 21, the regime regains full control of third city Homs with the Russian-supervised evacuation of Waer, its last rebel-held neighbourhood. On August 5, government forces recapture Al-Sukhna, the last IS stronghold in Homs province. On June 4, government forces troops seize the strategic town of Maskana from IS as part of a months-long operation to drive the jihadists out of Aleppo province. On June 30, they retake the last IS-held pocket in the province. In June, troops, backed by Iranian, Lebanese and Iraqi fighters, break into the strategic eastern province of Deir Ezzor. On October 14, they retake the town of Mayadeen from IS. On November 2, they take full control of Deir Ezzor itself, the last major city where the jihadists had a presence. On November 19, the army announces it has recaptured Albu Kamal on the Iraqi border, the last town in Syria still held by IS.','WORLD-MIDDLE-EAST','','2017-12-20 20:31:00','AFP | Dec 20, 2017, 20:31 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:02'),(813,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-rejects-as-preposterous-vote-against-jerusalem-at-un-general-assembly/articleshow/62115258.cms','Israel rejects as preposterous vote against Jerusalem at UN General Assembly','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62207658,width-400,resizemode-4/62207658.jpg]','JERUSALEM: Israel has rejected as \"preposterous\" the vote by 127 countries, including India, at the UN General Assembly that opposed the recent decision of US President Donald Trump to recognise Jerusalem as Israels capital. India on Thursday joined 127 other countries to vote in the United Nations General Assembly in favour of a resolution opposing the recent decision of US President Donald Trump to Jerusalem as Israels capital. Trump on December 6 announced that he would recognise Jerusalem as Israels capital and move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv, triggering protests and strong condemnation from across the world. Israel has rejected the \"preposterous\" vote at the UN General Assembly, thanking the nations that supported \"the truth\" by not participating in \"the theatre of the absurd\", Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. \"Jerusalem is our capital. Always was, always will be,\" Netanyahu said in a video message released immediately after the UN vote. \"But I do appreciate the fact that a growing number of countries refused to participate in this theatre of the absurd. So I appreciate that, and especially I want to again express our thanks to (US) President (Donald) Trump and Ambassador (Nikki) Haley, for their stalwart defence of Israel and their stalwart defence of the truth,\" Netanyahu said. The United Nations General Assembly yesterday defied the US and overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning the Trump administrations recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital, calling on countries not to move their diplomatic missions to the city. \"Let them vote against us... We dont care. But this isnt like it used to be where they could vote against you and then you pay them hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Trump had said on Wednesday threatening to withdraw US aid to countries that vote in favour of the UN resolution. \"Were not going to be taken advantage of any longer,\" the US President had asserted. Israeli Jewish politicians expressed their anger against the world body but Arab parliamentarians called it a \"wake up call\". Israels hawkish Defence Minister, Avigdor Liberman, reminded Israelis of the longstanding Israeli disdain for such votes. \"Let us just remember that this is the same UN about which our first ambassador to the organisation, Abba Eban, once said: If Algeria introduced a resolution declaring that the earth was flat and that Israel had flattened it, it would pass by a vote of 164 to 13 with 26 abstentions\", Liberman said. \"There is nothing new in what just happened at the UN,\" he added, and praised the US as \"the moral beacon shining out of the darkness\". Minister of Strategic Affairs and Public Security Gilad Erdan also blasted the UN vote. \"The historic connection between Israel and Jerusalem is stronger than any vote by the United Nations -- nations who are united only by their fear and their refusal to recognise the simple truth that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and the Jewish people,\" Erdan said in a statement after the vote. He called upon for strengthening Israels sovereignty, security and construction in every part of Jerusalem. However, the top Arab lawmaker in the Knesset, Arab Joint List chairman Ayman Odeh, said the vote was a wake-up call for Israel. \"In the international arena, there still exists a large and definitive majority that believes that the Palestinian people, like all other nations, deserve a place in this world and the right to self-determination,\" he said in a statement. \"This evenings vote by the majority of the worlds nations against Trumps announcement, in spite of the pressure and threats, flies in the face of Trumps and Netanyahus diplomatic policy and is a clear statement by the international community in support of peace and the right of the Palestinians to an independent state, whose capital is East Jerusalem,\" Odeh added. Noa Landau, an analyst for the daily Haaretz, citing diplomatic sources, said that Israel was particularly disappointed with countries like India that have enhanced bilateral relations with it recently. \"The main disappointment in Israel was with the countries that have enhanced bilateral relations in recent years, especially those that share a particularly conservative worldview with the Netanyahu government,\" Landau wrote. \"For example, India - whose Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, visited Israel in July, a tour that was memorable mainly for the pastoral photographs of him and Netanyahu embracing and wading in the waves - voted for the resolution against Israel and the United States,\" she said.

On Twitter, Haley posted on Twitter that \"the US will be taking names\" during the vote on Thursday at the 193-nation assembly. Turkey and Yemen requested the urgent meeting on behalf of the Arab group of countries and the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The two countries circulated a draft resolution on Tuesday that mirrors the vetoed measure, reaffirming that any decision on the status of Jerusalem has no legal effect and must be rescinded. Egypt had put forward the draft at the council which was backed by all 14 other Security Council members in the vote on Monday. Like the Egyptian draft, the text before the assembly does not mention Trumps decision but expresses \"deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem.\" Palestinian ambassador Riyad Mansour said he expected \"overwhelming support\" for the measure stating that Jerusalem is an issue \"to be resolved through negotiations\" between Israel and the Palestinians. \"The General Assembly will say, without the fear of the veto, that the international community is refusing to accept the unilateral position of the United States,\" Mansour told reporters. No country has veto powers in the General Assembly, contrary to the council where the United States, along with Britain, China, France and Russia, can block any resolution. Trumps December 6 decision to recognize Jerusalem broke with international consensus, triggering protests across the Muslim world and drawing strong condemnation. Key US allies Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Ukraine were among the 14 countries in the 15-member council that voted in favor of the measure. After that vote, Haley described the 14-1 vote \"an insult\" and warned \"it wont be forgotten.\" She went further on Tuesday, warning in her Twitter post: \"At the UN were always asked to do more & give more.

Israel seized control of the eastern part of the city in the 1967 Middle East war and sees all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital.

He was convicted of violating military regulations banning political activism by active duty officers, he added. The verdict can be appealed.

If his conviction of alleged indecency _ widely seen to be politically motivated _ is upheld, he could be disqualified from running. Another potential candidate is Ahmed Shafiq, a retired air force general who served as the last prime minister under autocrat Hosni Mubarak, ousted in a popular uprising in 2011. Shafiq narrowly lost to the Islamist Mohammed Morsi in 2012. Shortly after, he left for the United Arab Emirates where he lived in self-imposed exile until early this month, when he returned home. He later said in a television interview that he wanted to take stock of conditions in Egypt before he makes a final decision in whether to run.','WORLD-MIDDLE-EAST','','2017-12-19 20:06:00','AP | Dec 19, 2017, 20:06 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:02'),(817,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/a-selfie-forces-ms-iraqs-family-to-flee/articleshow/62127719.cms','A selfie forces Ms Iraq’s family to flee','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62127714,width-400,resizemode-4/62127714.jpg]','The family of Miss Iraq has been forced to flee the country after the beauty queen posted selfies with Miss Israel.

The Arab worlds largest economy and one of the worlds top oil producers was hit by a drop in oil prices more than three years ago, but austerity measures have helped ease the blow. Revenue is expected to reach 783 billion riyals ($209 billion), with oil revenue making up the bulk of that at 63 percent and non-oil revenue comprising the remaining 37 percent. Revenue for this past year reached 696 billion riyals ($186 billion). The government said the budget deficit this past year was 230 billion riyals ($61 billion) — a steady decline from 297 billion riyals ($79 billion) in 2016 and 367 billion riyals ($98 billion) 2015. The government projects a budget deficit in the coming year of even less at 195 billion riyals ($52 billion). Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, continues to spend heavily on its nearly three-year-long war in Yemen and on acquiring weapons and beefing up its military. In a speech broadcast live on state TV, King Salman said the government plans to have a balanced budget by 2023, forecasting another five years of deficit. The kingdom had initially planned to have a balanced budget sooner, but the International Monetary Fund cautioned that the pace of fiscal consolidation was to give households and businesses more time to adjust. To help ease the burden of planned subsidy cuts next year on electricity, fuel and gas, the government is preparing to distribute cash assistance to low-income families as part of a new welfare system. More than 3.7 million families have applied for assistance in the so-called \"Citizens Account, representing more than 13 million people — or more than half the Saudi population, though not all will qualify for support. The first payments will be made Dec. 21 before next years subsidy cuts and the introduction Jan. 1 of a 5 percent value-added tax next year on most goods, like food, and services. The kingdom has already put in place a sin tax on tobacco, soft drinks and energy drinks, and lifted some energy subsidies in late 2015. The king said in his speech before the Cabinet on Tuesday when announcing the budget that it includes allocations for housing and funds ``to push the economic wheel forward, and provide more employment opportunities for male and female citizens. Unemployment in Saudi Arabia rose this year to 12.8 percent. Government statistics show that women make up the overwhelming majority of job seekers in Saudi Arabia. Also, around 34 percent of Saudis seeking employment are between 25 and 29 years old. That number is expected to grow with half the population under 25. The kingdom is also urgently trying to attract more international investment and buoy the private sector to create millions of jobs in the coming years. However, an anti-corruption purge led by the kings son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has raised concerns among international investors.','WORLD-MIDDLE-EAST','','2017-12-19 22:09:00','AP | Dec 19, 2017, 22:09 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:02'),(819,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-says-it-intercepts-houthi-missile-fired-toward-riyadh-no-reported-damage/articleshow/62136639.cms','Saudi Arabia says it intercepts Houthi missile fired towards Riyadh, no reported damage','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62136659,width-400,resizemode-4/62136659.jpg]','RIYADH: Saudi air defences intercepted a ballistic missile fired towards the capital Riyadh on Tuesday but there were no reports of casualties, the Saudi-led coalition said, the latest in a series of attacks by an Iran-aligned group in Yemen. A spokesperson for the Houthi movement said a ballistic missile targeted the royal court at al-Yamama palace, where a meeting of Saudi leaders was under way. There was no official word on this assertion, but a royal family member appeared to confirm the missile was aimed at a royal palace meeting. \"Coalition forces confirm intercepting an Iranian-Houthi missile targeting (the) south of Riyadh. There are no reported casualties at this time,\" the government-run Center for International Communication wrote on its Twitter account. The attack happened hours before Saudi Arabia was due to announce the countrys annual budget in a news conference expected to be attended by senior ministers. Reuters witnesses described hearing a blast and said they saw smoke in the north-east of Riyadh. Saudi Arabia said on November 4 it had intercepted a ballistic missile over Riyadhs King Khaled Airport, in an attack that provoked a strong reaction from the kingdom. Riyadh accused Iran of smuggling the missile to the Houthis and imposed a blockade on Yemen demanding that united Nations inspection procedures be tightened. Last week, the United States presented for the first time pieces of what it said were Iranian weapons supplied to the Houthis, describing it as conclusive evidence that Tehran was violating UN resolutions. Iran, Saudi Arabias regional foe, has denied supplying such weaponry to the Houthis who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country during its civil war. In Geneva, a UN human rights spokesperson said air strikes by a Saudi-led military coalition had killed at least 136 civilians and non-combatants in Yemen since December 6.

In May, members of NGO Yuvsatta, Chandigarh Tree Lovers (CTL) and TOI joined hands to identify the oldest and most magnificent trees in Chandigarh. But the fight for the preservation of these trees dates back to 2005. Chandigarh was expanding and these mature trees were in the way. To save them, the NGO Yuvsatta first planned the Heritage Trees Project in 2005 in collaboration with the department of environment, Chandigarh administration. During a survey, they found more than 1,000 trees in Chandigarh which could be given the status of heritage trees. But nothing much could be done then. \"We identified hundreds of such trees. Meetings were organised and a board was formed to prepare recommendations but the project did not take off in the expected direction,\" said Pramod Sharma, coordinator, Yuvsatta. The efforts were revived this year. \"I met home secretary Anurag Aggarwal and shared the concern for heritage trees, many of which were vulnerable to diseases and were dying. Sharing similar concerns, he looked at the report prepared initially. He felt it would not be feasible to declare so many trees as heritage trees and so asked if we could prepare a report on the oldest trees. It was then that we collaborated with CTL and TOI and identified 31 trees located in different places,\" Sharma said. All members came together for the two-month exercise conducted in May and June and visited different trees in the early hours. \"The efforts have finally paid off,\" said jubilant group members. \"We are very happy that our combined efforts have paid off and the trees have got their due status. We will be happier if people in general respect not only heritage trees but all the others as well,\" said Shelly Mathur, Member CTL. \"The entire CTL team is elated at the heritage status.

Acting on a representation made by Haryana BJP vice-president Rajiv Jain, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has constituted a three-member committee headed by health minister Anil Vij to conduct a study and submit the report in the matter. Apart from Vij, the other two members of the committee are: Urban local bodies minister Kavita Jain and BJP MLA from Faridabad Seema Trikha. The committee is exploring the possibilities of having one-year term for the office-bearers of the local bodies on the line of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation. The initiative is termed to be important as seven municipal corporations and 13 municipal councils will go to polls in June next year. Sources said that one reason behind the move was that after change of guard in the state in October 2014, the BJP government could not do much in changing or unseating the heads of civic bodies. Municipal corporations of Panchkula, Ambala and Rohtak have mayors as elected heads and the three civic bodies have been dogged by controversies ever since the BJP government came to power in Haryana. Fear of horse trading of councillors forced the government to refrain from initiating any action of bringing no-confidence motion against mayors of these cities. Jain said the committee was in the advanced stages of finalizing its report and its next meeting was scheduled to be held on December 27. \"The initiative is one of the measures to ensure development of cities. If the tenure of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor is reduced to one year, then at least five councillors will get opportunity to head the civic body. This will increase the competency as well,\" she said. The committee is exploring the possibilities of other changes as well, she added. When contacted, Panchkula and Rohtak mayors flayed the governments decision. \"This will not only distract the councillors but will derail all works undertaken by the mayors and their team. It takes at least one year for a mayor to understand the system. It will hit back at the government,\" said Rohtak mayor Renu Dabla. Endorsing her views, Panchkula mayor Upender Walia said, \"They have been at it for the past three years. This is not a practical decision. Nobody can work in eight months as four months of a year are gone in procedures. I doubt if committee will recommend a shorter tenure,\" said Walia.','CITY-CHANDIGARH','Manvir Saini','2017-12-23 07:21:00','| TNN | Dec 23, 2017, 07:21 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:02'),(824,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/trucker-held-for-gang-rape-of-us-woman-over-two-years-ago/articleshow/62216271.cms','Ludhiana truck driver held for gang rape of US woman','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62216286,width-400,resizemode-4/62216286.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/62216288/Master.jpg]','CHANDIGARH: A truck driver has been arrested from Ludhiana for allegedly raping an American woman in Kharar more than two years ago.

The order is likely to affect at least 9,000 big and small buildings for which the state government had received the applications to decide the compounding fee and allow regularization. Division bench of acting Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan, in a detailed judgment, pointed out that by virtue of the impugned amendment, the state has created a separate and distinct class, which consisted of those persons who may have or may not have any sanction to carry out any development activity and yet would be regularized. In a populist move, the Congress government had made the amendment in the Himachal Pradesh Town & Country Planning Act, 1977, by inserting Section 30-B. On August 27, 2016, the government introduced the Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Act, 2016, in the legislative assembly and sent it to the governor the same day. Himachal Pradesh governor Acharya Devvrat on January 24, 2017, gave ascent to the controversial legislation. The amended Act conferred power upon the government, empowered officer or authority \"to exempt development of any land or building or class of lands or buildings developed on or before June 15, 2016, from all or any of the provisions of the Act, save and except certain exceptions, on payment of specified regularization fee\". Significantly, successive governments had brought retention policies on five occasions earlier. All those were, however, confined to Shimla. The regularization Act covered the entire state. The state governments move in the run up to the assembly election, however, ran into trouble as a set of petitions were filed in the high court to challenge the amendment on the ground of it being illegal. On Friday, the court pointed out that rather than dealing sternly and demolishing unauthorized structures, defaulters were being offered regularization on a platter. The economically affluent and perhaps close to the executive, political or otherwise, who violated the laws with impunity, alone were going to be the beneficiaries, HC said. \"It is not that the authorities, including the legal bodies, did not have the wherewithal to deal with the menace, but the apathy, lethargy, insensitivity and callousness has only resulted into such a situation,\" it added. The court said that only the will to do so was lacking. In fact, the state could have exercised power under Section 35 of the Planning Act to frame a scheme for better planning of construction activity. It said that Act does not try to protect the naive, the innocent and the people belonging to marginal sections of society, who may have raised construction through honest means. \"Insertion of Section 30-B by the amending Act is contrary to the object and purpose of the Principal Act, as also ultra vires the Constitution of India, as such we strike it down,\" court ruled.','CITY-CHANDIGARH','','2017-12-23 07:15:00','TNN | Dec 23, 2017, 07:15 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:02'),(830,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/adarsh-school-teachers-protest-on-top-of-faridkot-administrative-complex/articleshow/62215034.cms','Adarsh school teachers protest on top of Faridkot administrative complex','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62216319,width-400,resizemode-4/62216319.jpg]','BATHINDA: Continuing with demonstrations against the management of Adarsh schools at Pakka and Midduman villages in Faridkot, protesting teachers climbed on to the terrace of the district administrative complex here on Friday.

The order will have a huge ramification across the country as a large number of ex-servicemen with a diploma in engineering and appointed junior engineers in various states were promoted to higher posts on the basis of the notification, allegedly issued on May 26, 1977 by the Centre. The high court found that the document used as the notification since 1977 was in fact \"an unsigned document and did not qualify even to be termed as an office memorandum.\" Justice Ajay Tewari has passed these orders while disposing of a petition filed by Sirsa resident, Salaudeen and several other officers posted as sub-divisional engineers/assistant engineers in the Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (HVPNL). The court also ordered the HVPNL to quash its seniority list, which was prepared by considering claims of ex-servicemen on the basis of the \"1977 notification\" and directed it to reframe the seniority list after withdrawing the benefits granted to the ex-servicemen. The Haryana government has been given six months to complete the entire exercise. Fake notification: Quash seniority list of power body, says HC The court also ordered the HVPNL to quash its seniority list, which was prepared by considering claims of ex-servicemen on the basis of the \"1977 notification\" and directed it to reframe the seniority list after withdrawing the benefits granted to the ex-servicemen. The Haryana government has been given six months to complete the entire exercise. In this case, several exservicemen had applied for appointment as junior engineers in 2004-2005. At the time, they all had a diploma in engineering and 10 years experience. They, however, did not claim to be degree holders and were appointed as diploma holders. Six years later, when the case of promotion to the post of assistant engineer was to be considered, the rules provided for a quota of 12 ½% to persons who held a degree or an equivalent qualification. At that stage, the ex-servicemen started claiming that in view of their diploma and their 10-year experience they were entitled to be considered as degree holders in view of the Centre \"notification\" dated May 26, 1977. Following that, they all were promoted in view of the notification. Their promotion was challenged by other officers with an engineering degree on the ground that no such notification had been issued by the Centre. Their contention was that by this fraudulent action, the ex-servicemen had stolen a march over them and consequently not only were they required to relinquish that benefit, they are also liable to be proceeded against. During the hearing of the case before the high court, the Union government stated there is a huge lapse on the part of the government machinery in so much as, for 40 years a particular benefit has been given to many persons without there being any authorisation for the same. The Centre informed the high court it had failed to find any proof of such notification in any government record. The ex-servicemen, on the other hand, argued that for the past 40-years this benefit was granted to them across the board and withdrawing it at this stage would be extremely unfair to them.','CITY-CHANDIGARH','Ajay Sura','2017-12-23 07:42:00','| TNN | Dec 23, 2017, 07:42 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:02'),(834,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/punjab-cm-birender-to-attend-jat-sabha-event/articleshow/62215029.cms','Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, Birender to attend Jat Sabha event','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62216328,width-400,resizemode-4/62216328.jpg]','CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh will be chief guest at an event to be organized to commemorate the birth anniversary of Deenbandhu Sir Chhotu Ram at Chandigarh on January 21, 2018.

Pakistan-based Edhi Foundation and India-based Pakistan-India Peoples Forum for Peace and Democracy (PIPFPD) have appealed to Indian and Pakistani governments to not confiscate boats of fishermen, saying that this affected their futures. \"Fishermen are not criminals, but workers. They should be treated accordingly; their boats, fishing net and other paraphernalia should be returned immediately by both countries,\" said a managing trustee of Edhi Foundation, Faisal Edhi, while talking to TOI over the phone from Karachi on Friday. Faisal said Pakistan would release 291 prisoners in two batches of 145 and 146 fishermen on December 29 and January 8, respectively. \"We will receive them outside the jail, and arrange their food and transport to Wagah border,\" said Faisal. When fishermen are arrested, they are sent to jail for illegally entering into the other countrys territory and their boats are seized, said PIPFPD general secretary Jatin Desai, adding that after completion of jail term, which lasts from a year to two and a half, the fishermen were released, but their boats were never returned. \"At present, Pakistan has around 900 Indian fishermens boats, each costing around Rs 45 lakh, while India has around 200 Pakistani fishermens boats, each costing around Rs 25 lakh, since Pakistani boats are smaller in size,\" he said. Faisal suggested that when fishermen are found in the other countrys territorial waters, their boats should be pushed back and they should not be arrested or their boats confiscated. Faisal said since boats and fishing nets were expensive, these should be returned immediately to their owners. Jatin said Pakistan, in March 2015, returned 52 boats and promised to return another 22, but never did so. \"Many boats have been damaged beyond repair and many auctioned,\" said Jatin. In the past, a released Indian fisherman, Dana, had informed TOI that the boat owners were reluctant to hire them again if they went back home after release from prison on the other side of the border.','CITY-CHANDIGARH','Yudhvir Rana','2017-12-23 07:19:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 07:19 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:02'),(836,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/festival-rush-chokes-kalka-shimla-trains/articleshow/62214950.cms','Festival rush chokes Kalka-Shimla trains','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62216368,width-400,resizemode-4/62216368.jpg]','CHANDIGARH: Do not plan a trip to the narrow gauge section of Kalka-Shimla during Christmas as all the seven trains plying on this section are jampacked.

In town recently, to attend a friends engagement, Nath talks about the citys contribution in his life as a song writer and filmmaker. Nath, who used to spend his summer vacations in Kanpur at his nanis place, says it was Kanpur where he used to get to watch movies. \"Meri naniji ji ka ghar Birhana road par hai. In my childhood, I used to spend the entire summer vacation here in Kanpur. My father was very strict and he never used to allow me to watch movies in Allahabad. Chhuttiyon main kabhi koi Bhakt Prahlad type ki movie aa jaye toh zaroor dekhne ko mil jaati thi. But when I used to come to Kanpur, I used to get the freedom of watching movies. Luckily there were lots of cinema halls near Birhana Road. And since my mamas used to give me lots of pocket money, I would watch a movie nearly every day. Movie ke baad wahin pe lage thele se khoob chaat-pakodi khaata tha. Dhokla was a novelty at that time because it used to be available only in Kanpur. There were so many attractions for me in Kanpur that I used to love coming here and I used to consider it my real home,\" says Sandeep. The song writer-director further adds, \"Kanpur is the place where I actually fell in love with movies. This is where I got exposed to Bollywood music too and the words of the songs would haunt me for days. I would think ki kya main bhi kabhi aise gaane likh paunga? And now, I am a lyricist and a filmmaker!\" Continuing with the thought, Sandeep says, \"At times I feel ki agar Kanpur main itni movie na dekhta toh shayad aaj main Bollywood mein na hota.\" Sharing some more memories of the city with us, Sandeep says, \"Whenever I used to come to Kanpur, I would go to bathe in the Ganga with my cousins. Uss time Ganga mein badi-badi boats chala karti thi. We could see the water till the horizon and it used to be a beautiful sight. But this time when I saw the Ganga here, I was shocked.

All three won by margins of over 79,000 votes. All the five winners belong to urban areas of Ahmedabad and Surat and are incidentally from BJP. While Surat has three, Ahmedabad has two in the top five list. Jankhana Patel, who contested from Choriyasi in Surat, is daughter of politician Raja Patel. After the death of Raja Patel in August 2015, she was elected from Choriyasi constituency in a byelection. She had won with a margin of 60,000 votes then. Patel was able to retain her seat in 2017 elections by a massive margin of 1,10,819 votes. \"This is unthinkable for an assembly seat. A win was assured, but not with such a margin,\" a family member said. \"This will make me to work harder for the people of coastal belt,\" said Patel, who hails from the coastal village of Dumas. When she was given ticket by BJP, she was a novice in politics. When 26-year-old Harsh Sanghvi was given ticket by BJP in 2012, many could not believe it. He proved his critics wrong then by winning Majura seat by a margin of 71,000 votes. \"Harsh has been one of the most approachable and social media savvy MLAs in the city. He has also been one of the most vocal MLAs and a person devoted to issues related to river conservation and environment,\" a BJP leader said.

Floor Space Index (FSI) of 4 would be granted by SMC for the project, which will come up on around 2.50 lakh square metre of land. Initially, four 61 floor buildings were envisaged, but now six 42 floor buildings would be constructed at the same site, sources said. The project upon its completion would become a multi-model transport hub (MMTS) that would integrate GSRTC, BRTS and city bus services with metro and high speed rail corridor and public and private transport, including railways and autorickshaws. \"Our new concept design would consume the entire FSI fully without compromising on development design. Care will be taken to maintain built up area and ensure complete integration of all aspects of the project which would be a landmark in India,\" Lohia said.

The increase was driven by a sharp increase in both exports of polished diamonds and jewellery as compared to the same month a year earlier, according to provisional data released by Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC). The apex body of the gems and jewellery sector said the surge has quashed fears of a slowdown following governments sudden demonetisation announcement of November 2016 coupled with the fact that Diwali festival — when cutting and polishing units are shut — was celebrated in November last year, but fell in October this year. The export of cut and polished diamonds from India in November witnessed an increase of $1.78 billion from $1.19 billion last year, a jump of 49.9%. Also, rough diamond imports shot up by 63.6% in value terms during the month to $1.95 billion as compared to $1.19 billion imported during the previous November. On the other hand, exports of gold jewellery (both studded and plain) during the month rose by 75.46% to $996.32 million from US $567.82 million a year earlier. Exports of silver jewellery dropped to $225.30 million in November 2017 as compared to $327.70 million in the same month last year.

The survey that began a couple of days ago comes after Dawoodi Bohra spiritual leader Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin spoke about switching to Indian toilets in his sermons. Since then the religious leaders have been propagating the idea among the community, saying Indian toilets are more hygienic than western-style commodes. The team members of the local mosque are visiting the Bohra residences, mainly concentrated in Zampa Bazaar and Begumpura, and the residents are asked to fill the inspection forms about their home toilets. There are questions asked in the form as to why they use western toilet, whether they are planning to change it, how much time they will take to change the toilet and a few other details.

I told my mother that we are not going to remove the western toilet,\" Kantawala said. Kantawala said, \"Majority of Bohras in Zampa Bazaar, the community hub, uses western toilet.

Renewable energy has become a hot area of trade friction as major economies compete to dominate a sector that is expected to thrive as reliance on coal and oil dwindles. India unveiled its national solar programme in 2011, seeking to ease chronic energy shortages in Asias third-largest economy without creating pollution. But the United States complained to the WTO in 2013, saying the programme was discriminatory and US solar exports to India had fallen by 90 percent from 2011. The United States won the case last year, when WTO appeals judges ruled India had broken the trade rules by requiring solar power developers to use Indian-made cells and modules. Such \"local content\" requirements are banned because they discriminate in favour of domestic firms and against foreign competitors. Under an agreement with the United States, India had until Dec. 14 to comply with the ruling and it told the DSB last week that it had done so. \"Indian authorities have held extensive internal stakeholder consultations since the adoption of the rulings and recommendations of the DSB to fully comply with them,\" India said in its statement to the DSB. \"Accordingly, in compliance with the findings and recommendations of the DSB in this dispute, India has ceased to impose any measures as found inconsistent in the DSBs findings and recommendations.\" But an agenda for the DSBs next meeting on Jan. 12 showed the United States plans to raise the dispute again, citing WTO rules on non-compliance with trade rulings. If India is found not to have complied, Washington could ask the WTO for permission to impose trade sanctions on India. But the WTO dispute system is struggling to process a large number of highly complex disputes, so the legal process is likely to continue for a year or more.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-20 21:13:00','Reuters | Dec 20, 2017, 21:13 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(875,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-has-put-pakistan-on-notice-for-harbouring-terrorists-pence/articleshow/62207361.cms','Trump has put Pakistan on notice for harbouring terrorists: Pence','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62207368,width-400,resizemode-4/62207368.jpg]','WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has put Pakistan on notice for providing safe haven to the Taliban and other militant groups, Vice President Mike Pence has said, warning that the country has much to lose if it does not stop harbouring terrorists on its soil.

During his visit yesterday, Pence held meetings with top Afghan leadership to hear from them the progress on the implementation of Trumps new South Asia Policy. Trump while announcing his South Asia Policy in August had criticised Pakistan for not doing enough to combat terrorism. \"For too long Pakistan has provided safe haven to the Taliban and many terrorist organisations, but those days are over. President Trump has put Pakistan on notice,\" Pence told American troops at the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. \"As the President said, so I say now: Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with the US, and Pakistan has much to lose by continuing to harbour criminals and terrorists,\" the vice president said, issuing another stern warning to Pakistan. Trump, he said, has unleashed the full range of American military might. \"Weve lifted the restrictions that limited the effectiveness of our armed forces, so you can, as the President has said, fully and swiftly wage battle against the enemy,\" Pence said. The Trump administration, he said, has given troops new authorities to directly target terrorists no matter where they hide. Trump has empowered battlefield commanders with the freedom and flexibility they need to win, Pence said, adding the presidents new strategy is already bearing fruit all across Afghanistan. \"For the partnerships we have forged and are continuing to forge to achieve peace and security here in Afghanistan but also ensure that peace and security for the people of the United States,\" Pence told reporters after his meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Prime Minister Abdullah Abdullah.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-22 14:50:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 22, 2017, 14:50 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(876,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-tastes-victory-at-last/articleshow/62192707.cms','Donald Trump tastes victory — at last','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62192731,width-400,resizemode-4/62192731.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Looking out over the South Lawn of the White House, flanked by the lawmakers who had just handed him the greatest victory of his tumultuous young presidency, Donald Trump drank in the scene. For this most unconventional of presidents — impulsive, unpredictable, so often frustrated by the exercise of power — it was payback time at last. In the chill December air, under a pale sky dotted with clouds, Trump was celebrating passage of the sweeping tax reform he promised to push through if American voters delivered him to the Oval Office. The much-anticipated event had been staged with care: lawmakers and advisors, primed to cheer and applaud, surrounded him at the lectern, and packed the majestic staircases that framed the scene. But the relief was plain to see in Trumps face as the businessman-turned-president — whose need for recognition appears to know no bounds — took the stand. Forgotten, for now, was the bitter failure to repeal Obamacare, his predecessors flagship health reform. Forgotten the vicious tweets and jabs pitting the president against members of his own Republican family, who now stood united behind congressional leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, slapping each other on the back. Forgotten the setbacks of recent polls — chief among them the defeat of Trumps candidate in Alabama, Roy Moore — which raised the specter of losing Republican control of Congress in the 2018 mid-term elections. For the 71-year-old president, it was a day for rejoicing, flanked by his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner — as well as Gary Cohn, Trumps economic advisor, ex-Goldman Sachs banker and chief architect of the tax reform. Trump had no speech as such to deliver — launching instead, with gusto, into a series of off-the-cuff remarks. He spoke of the \"tremendous enthusiasm right now in this country,\" cracked jokes about the ups and downs of power, how its \"always fun when you win.\" \"What does it mean? It means jobs, jobs, jobs,\" he quipped, promising the tax cuts will deliver a shot in the arm for the US economy. The president dished out smiles, pumped lawmakers hands — singled out this \"friend\" or that \"special person.\" And the Republicans returned the favor, taking turns to sing his praises. Setting the tone, House Speaker Paul Ryan credited Trumps \"exquisite presidential leadership\" for the success of the contentious tax plan, assailed by Democrats as a giveaway to the wealthiest that risks blowing a hole in the national debt Not to be outdone, Vice President Mike Pence doubled down with a superlative description of Trumps accomplishments — including a tax cut he dubbed \"a middle class miracle.\" \"President Donald Trump is a man of his word. Hes a man of action,\" said Pence. \"President Trump has been making history since the first day of this administration.\" For the real estate magnate, elected president with no prior experience of politics, it was a sweet victory indeed. When Trump first vowed to push through the Republican tax reform before Christmas, it raised amused eyebrows in Washington where many expected it to fall foul of presidents inexperience and divisions within his own camp. But several lawmakers admitted — in no uncertain terms — that tax reform was a make-or-break issue for the Republican party ahead of next years elections. \"This will indeed be a very big day, when people look back at our country,\" Trump concluded, before heading back to the Oval Office. Earlier Wednesday Trump had promised a press conference to celebrate the bills adoption. As it turned out, he took no questions. The presidents team is hoping this could mark a turning point for a leader whose popularity rating lags far below any of his predecessors this early in his term. But for now, the 45th president of the United States is preparing to spend Christmas break at his Mar-a-Lago golf resort, the \"Winter White House,\" basking in the Florida sunshine and the glow of his first legislative victory.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-21 15:21:00','AFP | Dec 21, 2017, 15:21 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(877,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-a-victory-for-trump-republican-tax-bill-passes-senate-in-51-48-vote/articleshow/62187408.cms','In a victory for Trump, Republican tax bill passes Senate in 51-48 vote','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62187411,width-400,resizemode-4/62187411.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/62187423/Master.jpg]','WASHINGTON: Jubilant Republican lawmakers laid plans to join President Donald Trump at the White House for a victory celebration on Wednesday as Congress moved one roll call away from approving the GOPs paramount priority, the most thorough reshaping of the countrys tax system since the 1980s. \"Workers benefit. Wages go up. More jobs occur,\" House speaker Paul Ryan, Republican from Wisconsin, said on Wednesday, describing what Republicans say will flow from a $1.5 trillion measure that affects everyones taxes but is dominated by breaks for business and higher earners. Democrats call the legislation a boon to the rich that leaves middle-class and working Americans behind. The Senate used a post-midnight vote to approve the measure on a party-line 51-48 tally. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, Republican from Kentucky, insisted Americans would respond positively to the tax bill. Trump has planned a White House news conference and a ceremony with GOP lawmakers after final congressional approval. In an eleventh-hour hiccup on Tuesday, the Senate parliamentarian found that three minor provisions violated Senate rules, forcing lawmakers to strip them out. Republicans had rammed the bill through the House 227-203 on Tuesday with all voting Democrats in opposition. Because of the language the Senate removed, the House had to revisit the measure on Wednesday because each chamber must approve identical legislation before it can be signed into law. Ryan, who has worked years toward the goal of revamping the tax code, gleefully pounded the gavel on Tuesdays House vote. GOP House members roared and applauded as they passed a package that will touch every American taxpayer and every corner of the US economy, providing steep tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy, and more modest help for middle- and low-income families. Trump tweeted his congratulations to GOP leaders and to \"all great House Republicans who voted in favour of cutting your taxes!\" Congressional Republicans, who faltered badly in trying to dismantle Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act, see passage of the tax bill as crucial to proving to Americans they can govern. The GOP has repeatedly argued the bill will spur economic growth as corporations, flush with cash, increase wages and hire more workers. But many voters in surveys see the legislation as a boost to the wealthy and a minor gain at best for the middle class. Tax cuts for corporations would be permanent while the cuts for individuals would expire in 2026 to comply with Senate budget rules. The legislation repeals an important part of the 2010 health care law — the requirement that all Americans carry health insurance or face a penalty — as the GOP looks to unravel the law it failed to repeal & replace this past summer.

The call came nearly a month after the two clashed over Trumps tweets of \"Britain First\" anti-Muslim propaganda and hours after London took the unusual step of voting against Washington at the United Nations. Britain was among 14 UN Security Council members who backed a resolution condemning Trumps decision to unilaterally recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital, leaving the United States alone to veto. \"They discussed the different positions we took on the recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, and agreed on the importance of the US bringing forward new proposals for peace and the international community supporting these efforts,\" a Downing Street spokesman said. \"The President and Prime Minister discussed next steps in forging peace in the Middle East,\" the White House said. There was no mention of the Twitter feud from either side, a row that has put Trumps state visit to the United Kingdom in further jeopardy. \"The two leaders exchanged holiday greetings and warm wishes for Christmas and the New Year,\" the White House said. They also discussed Britains negotiations to withdraw from the European Union, with the British side claiming that they \"agreed on the importance of a swift post-Brexit bilateral trade deal.\" There was no mention of such an agreement in Washingtons account of the call, although Trump has made similar pledges in the past. \"The prime minister updated the president on the recent good progress of the Brexit negotiations, and the president set out the progress he had made on his economic agenda,\" the Downing Street spokesman said. \"President Trump congratulated the Prime Minister on the decision by European Union leaders to move to the second phase of the Brexit negotiations,\" according to Washington. Earlier Tuesday, May chaired the first detailed cabinet discussion on Britains future trade ties, after European Union leaders last week approved an interim agreement on the terms of their separation, and agreed to move talks on to trade next year. London wants to secure \"the best possible trading terms with the EU\" that enable Britain \"to set rules that are right for our situation and facilitates ambitious third-country trade deals,\" Downing Street said after the meeting. May and Trump also talked about Yemen, with May \"highlighting our ongoing deep concerns at the humanitarian situation,\" according to Downing Street. \"They agreed on the vital importance of reopening humanitarian and commercial access to prevent famine and alleviate the suffering of innocent Yemenis,\" the spokesman said.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-20 09:13:00','AFP | Dec 20, 2017, 09:13 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(879,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-shock-move-us-sanctions-top-myanmar-general-for-atrocities-human-rights-abuses-in-rakhine-state/articleshow/62202239.cms','In shock move, US sanctions top Myanmar general for atrocities, human rights abuses in Rakhine state','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62202239,width-400,resizemode-4/62202239.jpg]','WASHINGTON: The United States on Thursday stepped back from a half-decade effort to forge closer relations with Myanmar, condemning a top general to a blacklist of shame for his role in atrocities against Rohingya Muslims. The new sanctions were the most serious U.S. response so far to what it calls ``ethnic cleansing in the western part of the Southeast Asian nation. The Trump administration announced penalties against 13 people worldwide in all. They included Gambias former president, the daughter of Uzbekistans late dictator and the son of Russias prosecutor general. The sanctions were the first set imposed under a 2016 law, named after a Russian lawyer who died in prison, that empowers the Treasury Department to target officials anywhere for human rights violations and corruption. The inclusion of Myanmars Maung Maung Soe on the list was perhaps the most dramatic move in terms of U.S. foreign policy. Washington progressively eased economic and political sanctions against Myanmar starting in 2012 to reward the country for its shift toward democracy after decades of military rule. Ties expanded further as Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi rose to power. But the relationship has soured since Myanmars crackdown in Rakhine state, which has forced 650,000 people to flee to neighboring Bangladesh and, according to aid group Doctors Without Borders, left thousands dead. Maung Maung Soe was until last month the military commander in Rakhine, and the U.S. said he was responsible for ``widespread human rights abuse, citing credible evidence of mass killings, rapes and villages being burned. Based on refugee accounts, The Associated Press has reconstructed one such massacre at the village of Maung Nu, where at least 82 Rohingya are believed to have been murdered on Aug. 27. Other prominent individuals punished Thursday include: _Yahya Jammeh, Gambias former president. He is alleged to have created an armed squad known as ``the Junglers that terrorized and killed numerous political foes, including religious leaders, journalists and dissidents, while he was in power from 1994 to 2017. Jammeh is also accused of plundering his countrys treasury by stealing at least $50 million in state funds. _Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of the late Uzbek strongman Islam Karimov. She is said to have headed an organized crime syndicate that used government agencies to expropriate businesses, monopolize markets, solicit bribes and run extortion rackets. _Artem Chaika, son of Russias Prosecutor General Yury Chaika. The younger Chaika is accused of using his family connections to unfairly buy state-owned assets and win contracts, as well as harass and interfere with competitors. The Treasury Departments action freezes any assets these people have under U.S. jurisdiction. Americans are banned from doing business with the individuals. Its unclear whether these people have extensive financial holdings or relationships in the United States. But the blacklist is designed to cause reputational damage that would get banks in Europe, Asia and elsewhere also to cut ties. ``Today, the United States is taking a strong stand against human rights abuse and corruption globally by shutting these bad actors out of the U.S. financial system, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. He said the penalties send a ``message that there is a steep price to pay for their misdeeds. The penalties are the first batch released under the Magnitsky Global Act, named for Russian whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, who died in prison after accusing Russian officials of massive tax fraud. It could help answer critics who say Trump has sidelined human rights in U.S. foreign policy and sought closer ties with authoritarian leaders. On Wednesday, the United States levied sanctions on five Russian officials under an earlier law, also named after Magnitsky, specifically targeting Russian officials. Among the others on Thursdays global list were an Israeli businessman alleged to have earned billions of dollars through corrupt mineral and oil deals with the president of Congo; a Serbian arms dealer; a Pakistani transplant specialist blamed for trafficking human organs and taking kidneys from people against their will; a former Chinese security director said to have mistreated human rights activists; and a former Ukrainian police commander accused of beating and killing peaceful protesters in 2014. The action against Maung Maung Soe will put fresh strain on U.S. relations with Myanmar, despite the Trump administrations assurance that it still seeks to support the nations democratic transition and Suu Kyis civilian government, which has little control over security affairs controlled by the still-powerful military. The U.S. has already barred Myanmar military officials involved in the Rakhine operations from U.S. assistance, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last week that the U.S. is examining other Myanmar individuals for possible sanctions. Myanmar denies allegations of human rights violations, saying its security forces have not targeted civilians and were responding to attacks by Rohingya militants in August. But it has blocked independent access to the region, including by the United Nations, and impeded delivery of humanitarian aid. Doctors Without Borders estimates at least 6,700 Rohingya civilians were killed in the first month of the crackdown, and human rights groups have documented three large-scale massacres.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-22 08:56:00','AP | Updated: Dec 22, 2017, 08:56 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(880,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-on-verge-of-tax-victory-as-us-senate-passes-overhaul/articleshow/62159892.cms','Trump on verge of tax victory as US Senate passes overhaul','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62160070,width-400,resizemode-4/62160070.jpg]','The US Senate narrowly approved a sweeping tax overhaul early Wednesday, putting President Donald Trump on the brink of his first major legislative triumph nearly a year after he took office.

The deepest rewrite of the tax code in three decades provides dramatic tax breaks to US corporations, and families at all incomes levels will see their income tax drop starting next year, with the largest benefits going to the wealthy. The Republican legislation passed the Senate along strict party lines, 51 votes to 48, with all Democrats united in opposition. The vote had appeared destined to a dramatic showdown, especially with Senator John McCains absence due to cancer treatment meaning Republicans could afford only one defector. Vice President Mike Pence presided over the chamber in the event he need to break a tie. But with senators Marco Rubio and Bob Corker backing off their threats to oppose the bill, it ultimately carried through, and Pence pronounced to loud cheers, \"the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is passed.\" In the House, 12 Republicans had joined all Democrats in opposition as the bill passed 227 to 203. \"Today we are giving the people of this country their money back,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, who forcefully banged the gavel down as he proclaimed victory. Trump, who has pushed hard to get the measure across the finish line, tweeted his congratulations to Ryan and all other \"great House Republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes!\" The procedural snafu only became apparent afterward. Senate Democrats said they demanded that three provisions in the bill- including one allowing the use of savings accounts for home-schooling expenses- be stripped out because they violate the Senates so-called Byrd Rule, guidelines on the kinds of legislation that can pass the Senate with just a simple majority. Democrats seized on the hiccup as proof that Republicans were rushing to jam the tax cuts through Congress without enough study. \"In the mad dash to provide tax breaks for their billionaire campaign contributors, our Republican colleagues forgot to comply with the rules of the Senate,\" senators Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden said in a statement. Republican leaders unveiled their final version of the bill only late last week, and Trump has demanded it reach his desk by Christmas. Should the bill become law, it would be the Republicans most important legislative victory in the 11 months since Trumps inauguration. The Republican plan is projected to add nearly $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the coming decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But that figure drops to about $1 trillion when economic growth is accounted for. Ryan stated that a median-income family of four earning $73,000 annually would save $2,059 in taxes next year. The Democratic opposition has denounced the measure as mostly benefiting companies and the wealthiest Americans- including Trump himself- and warns it risks blowing a hole in the national debt, which has surged past $20 trillion. Top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi called the bill a \"moral obscenity,\" and \"brazen theft from the American middle class.\" Under the legislation, the federal corporate tax rate would fall from 35 per cent to 21 per cent, and the maximum individual income tax rate, for the nations wealthiest, would drop from 39.6 percent to 37 percent. While Republicans failed earlier this year to repeal and replace Obamacare, the tax plan takes a key step in that regard, by scrapping the individual mandate that requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-20 12:25:00','AFP | Dec 20, 2017, 12:25 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(881,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/southern-california-wildfire-largest-on-record/articleshow/62217937.cms','Southern California wildfire largest on record','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62218018,width-400,resizemode-4/62218018.jpg]','LOS ANGELES: The wildfire, which has razed 273,400 acres in southern California so far, has become the largest wildfire in the state since records began.

The two pieces of legislation represent Trumps most significant accomplishment with Congress since taking office in January, as well as a sign of what awaits when he returns from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after the Christmas holiday. The tax package, the largest such overhaul since the 1980s, slashes the corporate rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent and temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals as well. Democrats had opposed the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy that would add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt during the next decade. The spending bill extends federal funding through Jan. 19, largely at current levels. It does nothing to resolve broader disputes over immigration, healthcare and military spending. Republicans also are divided over whether to follow up their sweeping overhaul of the US tax code with a dramatic restructuring of federal benefit programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he would like to revamp welfare and health programs but Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told National Public Radio on Monday that he was not interested in cutting those programs without Democratic support.','WORLD-US','','2017-12-22 21:55:00','Reuters | Dec 22, 2017, 21:55 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(885,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/india-joins-more-than-100-countries-to-reject-donald-trumps-jerusalem-move/articleshow/62200989.cms','India joins more than 100 countries to reject Donald Trump’s Jerusalem move','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62200979,width-400,resizemode-4/62200979.jpg]','NEW DELHI: India joined 127 other countries in the UN General Assembly on Thursday to vote for a resolution that effectively rejected United States president Donald Trumps move to recognise Jerusalem as Israels capital, declaring it \"null and void\". The resolution was passed 128 to 9 and 35 abstentions. The US was joined by Israel, Honduras, Guatemala, Togo, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Micronesia, and a notable abstention was the USs neighbour Canada. The resolution was in support of the long-standing international consensus that the status of Jerusalem — which is claimed by both Israel and the Palestinians as a capital — can only be settled as an agreed final issue in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. This was the second time in a week that the US found itself isolated on this issue. On Tuesday, the United Nations Security Council voted on an Egypt-sponsored resolution 14-1, with the US using its veto power to block the vote. On Thursday, all key US allies — UK, France, Germany, Ireland, Belgium, Portugal, Spain and China — voted to condemn USs move to shift its embassy to Jerusalem. There had been speculation that India might vote with the US given its growing closeness with both US and Israel. But in September, addressing the NAM (Non-Aligned Movement) committee on the Palestine cause on the sidelines of the UNGA, foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj said, \"Indias expanding relations in the region would strengthen the Palestinian cause. During PMs visit to Israel we reiterated the need for a just and durable peace in the region. The path to this clearly lies in an early negotiated solution between Israel and Palestine based on mutual recognition and security arrangements.\" It was during Indias chairmanship of NAM in 1983 that the committee on Palestine was set up. The vote comes after Trump himself threatened to cut aid to countries who voted against the US. The USs envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, was even more blunt. \"The US will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation,\" Haley said on Thursday. \"We will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the worlds largest contribution to the United Nations. And we will remember it when so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit.\"','WORLD-US','Indrani Bagchi','2017-12-22 01:11:00','| TNN | Dec 22, 2017, 01:11 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(886,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/dharmendra-pradhan-urges-centre-to-consider-odishas-proposal-on-tourism-projects/articleshow/62198826.cms','Dharmendra Pradhan urges Centre to consider Odisha’s proposal on tourism projects','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62198817,width-400,resizemode-4/62198817.jpg]','BHUBANESWAR: Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday urged his cabinet colleague and Union tourism minister KJ Alphons to fast-track some tourism projects in Odisha proposed by the state government. \"Five additional projects have been submitted by the state government for consideration under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme.

Bijoy, a national executive member and a native of Kendrapada district, who of late has been at odds with the partys state leadership, smelled a conspiracy by some senior state leaders to sack him. \"It is a long drawn plan to throw me out. Instead of fighting for the people, their agenda is to fight against me. The process to remove me was on for some months. If anybody feels the party can do better without me I wish them luck,\" Bijoy told TOI. Kendrapada district president Duryodhan Sahoo said the committee led by him has decided to drop Bijoy as a special invitee to the district panel and has urged party president Amit Shah and state chief Basanta Panda to remove him from the BJPs primary membership. The development comes a day after two factions of BJP workers fought against each other during an event at Singitia village in Garadapur block of Kendrapada on the issue of members of rival political parties joining the saffron camp. Sahoo said supporters of Bijoy were behind the ruckus. Speaking about the charges, Bijoy said the cadres who were not invited for the event reacted in that manner. \"If the leadership wants to defame me for that, I cant help it. I am with the people and I will be with them and will continue to raise their issues,\" he added. State vice-president Sameer Mohanty dismissed the conspiracy angle and said Bijoy needs to make up his mind whether or not he wants to stay with the BJP. \"He has been speaking in a different tone than the partys. He has not even spared criticising the Prime Minister,\" Mohanty said. On December 10, Bijoy had endorsed BJDs allegation that the Union government was favouring Chhattisgarh in the Mahanadi water sharing dispute, embarrassing his own party. \"Mahanadi issue is not partisan, it is in the states interest,\" Bijoy had then reasoned. A founder leader of the BJD, Bijoy joined the BJP in 2009. Following his acrimonious exit from the regional party in 2000, when he was denied a ticket on the eve of the assembly election, Bijoy went on to form the Odisha Gana Parishad (OGP) in 2001 and six years later merged it with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). When NCP decided to go for a pre-poll alliance with the BJD in 2009, Bijoy left and joined the BJP.','CITY-BHUBANESWAR','Ashok Pradhan','2017-12-23 09:05:00','| TNN | Dec 23, 2017, 09:05 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(888,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/cold-wave-to-sweep-state-in-run-up-to-new-year/articleshow/62202588.cms','Cold wave to sweep state in run-up to New Year','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62202596,width-400,resizemode-4/62202596.jpg]','BHUBANESWAR: Odisha is headed for a spell of cold wave in the run-up to the New Year, reads the latest forecast of the Met department.

Yet labourers seem reluctant in availing work under MGNREGS owing to non-receipt of wages on time, leading to distress migration. Naveen also requested Union rural development minister Narendra Singh Tomar to allow the government to use its corpus of Rs 300 crore that the state has created to pay labourers wages in case of delay in payment by the Centre. The same can be possible if the Centre comes out with guidelines for use of such corpus funds. \"To ensure timely release of fund to the labourers, the state government has the corpus in 2017-18 budget.

The cluttered signage creates an obstacle for a beautiful view of the heritage zone. But the Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) has drafted Heritage Signage Guidelines for Ekamra Kshetra to maintain its sanctity. The guidelines say all hoarding and signage, which destroy or damage the architectural character of the building, will be removed. \"The building signs (both residential and commercial) shall not be painted on the original face of the laterite wall, brick wall, sandstone, terracotta and tiling of any other surface that is built with traditional knowledge and technology,\" said a BDA officer. The guidelines, besides the building signs, cover all types of directional, locational, interpretation, location map, facility and emergency signage, shop and advertisement signage to provide an uncluttered environment of the heritage zone. \"The colour, text, font, material and scale of all signs should be historically sensitive to the structure and the distinctiveness of the Old Town area,\" said BDA sources. Any new signage needs a prior authorisation from the concerned authority. \"If we find any organisation or individual violating the provisions, action will be taken against him/her. In case of proven deliberate neglect of the heritage building or precinct or any damaged caused to the structure, no development permission will be granted on the site to construct any new building,\" said city mayor AN Jena. The design criteria would follow appropriate fonts, line spacing, layout/paragraph style, letter height, letter case and arrows and symbols used. The principles behind the signage, on the other hand, would focus on scale, placement, safety, clutter, context, material, colour and workmanship. The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also started the process to install a set of 521 route signage in Old Town area. The information on the signage will be in Odia, Hindi and English and will cost the state Rs 2.75 crore.','CITY-BHUBANESWAR','Hemanta Pradhan','2017-12-22 20:24:00','| Dec 22, 2017, 20:24 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(898,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/naveen-patnaik-dismisses-damodar-rout-from-cabinet-for-casteist-remarks/articleshow/62213933.cms','Naveen Patnaik dismisses Damodar Rout from Cabinet for casteist remarks','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62213934,width-400,resizemode-4/62213934.jpg]','BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday dismissed senior cabinet minister Damodar Rout from the council of ministers for his casteist remarks on Brahmin community that created furore in the state. \"I strongly disapprove anyone who makes derogatory remarks against any cast, creed or religion.

He was critical of the state government for failing to make arrests in the cases of murders of Hindu activists, scholar M M Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh.

Over the past year, mass disappearance of Uighur Muslims has instilled fear in the hearts of the marginalised ethnic community, which has been influenced by radical Islamic extremism, claims the government. Inhabited by 10 million Turkic speaking Uighurs, Xinjiangs Uighur Autonomous Region now resembles a police state, with foot patrols, armored vehicles and round-the-clock surveillance tracking their every move. Under the pretext of rooting out terrorism, the Chinese government has adopted a \"strike hard\" campaign following a series of attacks in 2013 and 2014 carried out by Uighur separatists. The Communist party has banned fasting during Ramzan, forbidden Azaan in state-sanctioned mosques, prohibited long beards and Islamic headwear and restricted use of the Turkic language. Harsh punishments are imposed for refusing to watch state TV or radio programmes. The government has also adopted sophisticated surveillance systems, including a biometric data collection program which collates \"three-dimensional portraits, voiceprints, DNA and fingerprints\", the AP report said. \"If we dont do this, it will be like several years ago — hundreds will die,\" propaganda official Bao Changhui told AP. Earlier in April, the Human Rights Watch condemned the move to ban dozens of Muslim names like Saddam and Jihad on the grounds that they could \"exaggerate religious fervour\". Children with banned names will not have access to public schools and other social benefits. The Communist Party has denied allegations of religious discrimination, instead pointing to decades of economic investment in Xinjiang and concerted efforts, such as preferential college admissions, to bring the Uighur population into the mainstream. It is a well-documented fact that Uighur Muslims have been fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan and also joined ISIS and al-Qaeda in Syria and Iraq. However, Beijing has not offered any concrete evidence of a foreign-directed terrorist organization working against the Chinese state that would warrant the crackdown on ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang. Even as it takes a hard-line stance on perceived Islamic extremism at home, China remains mostly aloof to reports of terrorist safe havens being nurtured by all-weather-ally Pakistan. Despite mounting pressure from the US, Islamabad has refused to step up its fight against terrorism and \"allows terror groups like the Haqqani Network, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) to operate freely from its soil\", the Trump administartion said in a censorious report in July. After endorsing the Xiamen declaration at the BRICS Summit 2017, which expressed concern for the first time on several Pakistan-based terror groups, China quickly backpedaled and attested to Islamabads \"clear conscience\" and \"great sacrifices\" in its counter-terror efforts. China has repeatedly blocked Indias move to designate JeM chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist at the UN Security Council and also opposed calls for sanctions against 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed. Hitting out at Beijings double standards on combating terrorism, India had said such actions only undermined the international communitys resolve to fight terror. This, in spite of concerns about terror groups in Pakistan that Chinese intelligence believes h as links to East Turkestan Islamic Movement, an influential separatist group in Uighur culture that has been designated as a terror outfit by the US and Britain. Meanwhile, Uighur Muslims continue to live in the shadow of fear in Xinjiang, under a government that all but views them as the enemy. Big Brother is watching.

The document, made public more than 28 years after the event, was seen by AFP at Britains National Archives. The estimate, given on June 5, 1989, the day after the crackdown, is almost 10 times higher than estimates commonly accepted at the time, which generally reported a toll ranging from several hundred to more than a thousand dead. But French sinologist Jean-Pierre Cabestan said the British figure was credible, pointing out that recently declassified US documents gave a similar assessment. \"Thats two pretty independent sources which say the same thing,\" said Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. The British ambassadors report was \"not particularly astonishing considering how crowded it was in Beijing, the number of people mobilised\" against the Chinese government, said Cabestan, who was in the Chinese capital in the days leading up to the crackdown. Donalds account gave horrific details of the violence unleashed on the night of June 3-4 when the army entered Beijing to end seven weeks of protests on Tiananmen Square, the symbolic heart of Communist power. During their advance, armoured personnel carriers \"opened fire on the crowd (both civilians and soldiers) before running over them in their APCs,\" wrote the ambassador, who said his source was a person who \"was passing on information given him by a close friend who is currently a member of the State Council\", the Chinese cabinet. Once the soldiers arrived in Tiananmen Square, \"students understood they were given one hour to leave square but after five minutes APCs attacked,\" Donald wrote. \"Students linked arms but were mown down including soldiers. APCs then ran over bodies time and time again to make pie and remains collected by bulldozer. Remains incinerated and then hosed down drains.\" At the end of June 1989, the Chinese government had said suppression of the \"counterrevolutionary riots\" had killed 200 civilians and several dozen police and military. Nearly three decades after the crackdown, the communist regime continues to forbid any debate on the subject, mention of which is banned from textbooks and the media, and censored on the Internet.','WORLD-CHINA','','2017-12-23 15:17:00','AFP | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 15:17 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(916,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/in-western-china-thought-police-instill-fear/articleshow/62104952.cms','In western China, thought police instill fear','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62105018,width-400,resizemode-4/62105018.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/62105024/Master.jpg]','KORLA: Nobody knows what happened to the Uighur student after he returned to China from Egypt and was taken away by police. Not his neighbors, not his classmates, not his mother. \"Is he dead or alive?\" the mother said, tears streaming down her face when Associated Press reporters visited her at home unexpectedly and showed her a photo of the student. The students friends think he joined thousands — possibly tens of thousands — of people who have been spirited away without trial into new indoctrination centers. The mass disappearances, beginning the past year, are part of efforts by Chinese authorities to use detentions and data-driven surveillance to impose a police state over the region of Xinjiang and its 10 million Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority that China says has been influenced by Islamic extremism. Unprecedented levels of police blanket Xinjiangs streets in many cities. Cutting-edge surveillance systems track where Uighurs go, what they read, who they talk to and what they say. Through rare interviews with Uighurs who recently left China, a review of government procurement contracts and unreported documents, and a trip through southern Xinjiang, the AP pieced together a picture of a campaign thats ostensibly rooting out terror — but instead instilling fear. Most of the more than a dozen Uighurs interviewed for this story spoke on condition of anonymity for fear that Chinese authorities would punish them or their family members. The AP is withholding the students name and other personal information to protect people who fear government retribution. The Xinjiang regional government did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But Chinas government describes its Xinjiang security policy as a \"strike hard\" campaign thats necessary following a series of attacks in 2013 and 2014, including a mass knifing in a train station that killed 33. A Hotan city propaganda official, Bao Changhui, told the AP: \"If we dont do this, it will be like several years ago — hundreds will die.\" China also points to decades of heavy economic investment and cultural assimilation programs and measures like preferential college admissions for Uighurs. Residents walk past a security checkpoint at the close of a open air market in Kashgar in western Chinas Xinjiang region. (AP Photo) Authorities refer to the detention program as \"vocational training,\" but its main purpose appears to be indoctrination. Training sessions on \"Mandarin, law, ethnic unity, de-radicalization, patriotism\" are described as lasting anywhere from 3 months to 2 years. In Korla, one center the AP visited was labeled a jail. Another was downtown on a street sealed off by rifle-toting police. Southern Xinjiang, where Korla is located, is one of the most heavily policed places on earth. In Hotan, police depots with flashing lights and foot patrols are set up every 500 meters. Motorcades of more than 40 armored vehicles rumble down city boulevards. Police checkpoints on every other block stop cars to check identification and smartphones for religious content. Xinjiangs published budget data shows public security spending this year is on track to increase 50 percent from 2016 to roughly 45 billion yuan ($6.8 billion) after rising 40 percent a year ago. Its quadrupled since 2009, when a Uighur riot broke out in Urumqi, killing nearly 200 people. But much of the policing goes unseen. Shoppers entering the Hotan bazaar must pass through metal detectors and place their national identification cards on a reader while having their faces scanned. AP reporters were stopped outside a hotel by a police officer who said the public security bureau had been remotely tracking the reporters movements by watching surveillance camera footage. The governments tracking efforts have extended to vehicles, genes and even voices. A biometric data collection program appears to have been formalized last year under \"Document No. 44,\" a regional public security directive to \"comprehensively collect three-dimensional portraits, voiceprints, DNA and fingerprints.\" The documents full text remains secret, but the AP found at least three contracts referring to the 2016 directive in recent purchase orders for equipment such as microphones and voice analyzers. China has also turned to a familiar low-tech surveillance tactic: recruiting the masses. A Uighur businessman from Kashgar who fled China said his four brothers and his father were in prison because of his escape and that families tasked with spying on one another in his community had also been punished. Members from each were sent to re-education centers for three months, he told the AP. A document obtained by US-based activists and seen by the AP shows Uighur residents in the Hebei Road West neighborhood in Urumqi, the regional capital, being graded on a 100-point scale. Those of Uighur ethnicity are automatically docked 10 points. Being aged between 15 and 55, praying daily, or having a religious education, all result in 10 point deductions. A neighborhood police official in Urumqi surnamed Tao confirmed that every community committee in the city needed to conduct similar assessments. Uighurs abroad say its too risky to stay in touch with their families in China. When Salih Hudayar, an American Uighur graduate student, last called his 70-something grandfather this summer, the elderly man told him kindly not to call again. He later heard his grandfather had been sent to an indoctrination camp. A Uighur student who moved to Washington following the crackdown this summer said that after his move, his wife, a government worker still in Urumqi, messaged to say the police would show up at her home in 20 minutes. She had to say goodbye: after that she would delete him permanently from her contacts list. Later, he couldnt help himself placing one last call home. His daughter picked up. \"Mom is sick but she doesnt want me to speak to you. Goodbye,\" she said.','WORLD-CHINA','','2017-12-17 14:39:00','AP | Dec 17, 2017, 14:39 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(917,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/hoping-to-extend-maritime-reach-china-lavishes-aid-on-pakistan-town/articleshow/62103856.cms','Hoping to extend maritime reach, China lavishes aid on Pakistan town','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62107161,width-400,resizemode-4/62107161.jpg]','GWADAR: China is lavishing vast amounts of aid on a small Pakistani fishing town+ to win over locals and build a commercial deep-water port that the United States and India suspect may also one day serve the Chinese navy. Beijing has built a school, sent doctors and pledged about $500 million in grants for an airport, hospital, college and badly-needed water infrastructure for Gwadar, a dusty town whose harbour juts out into the Arabian Sea, overlooking some of the worlds busiest oil and gas shipping lanes. The grants include $230 million for a new international airport, one of the largest such disbursements China has made abroad, according to researchers and Pakistani officials. The handouts for the Gwadar project is a departure from Beijings usual approach in other countries. China has traditionally derided Western-style aid in favour of infrastructure projects for which it normally provides loans through Chinese state-owned commercial and development banks. \"The concentration of grants is quite striking,\" said Andrew Small, an author of a book on China-Pakistan relations and a Washington-based researcher at the German Marshall Fund think tank. \"China largely doesnt do aid or grants, and when it has done them, they have tended to be modest.\" Pakistan has welcomed the aid with open hands. However, Beijings unusual largesse has also fuelled suspicions in the United States and India that Gwadar is part of Chinas future geostrategic plans to challenge US naval dominance. \"It all suggests that Gwadar, for a lot of people in China, is not just a commercial proposition over the longer term,\" Small said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Beijing and Islamabad see Gwadar as the future jewel in the crown of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship of Beijings Belt and Road initiative to build a new \"Silk Road\" of land and maritime trade routes across more than 60 countries in Asia, Europe and Africa. The plan is to turn Gwadar into a trans-shipment hub and megaport to be built alongside special economic zones from which export-focused industries will ship goods worldwide. A web of energy pipelines, roads and rail links will connect Gwadar to Chinas western regions. Port trade is expected to grow from 1.2 million tonnes in 2018 to about 13 million tonnes by 2022, Pakistani officials say. At the harbour, three new cranes have been installed and dredging will next year deepen the port depth to 20 metres at five berths. But the challenges are stark. Gwadar has no access to drinking water, power blackouts are common and separatist insurgents threaten attacks against Chinese projects in Gwadar and the rest of Balochistan, a mineral-rich province that is still Pakistans poorest region. Security is tight, with Chinese and other foreign visitors driven around in convoys of soldiers and armed police. Beijing is also trying to overcome the distrust of outsiders evident in Balochistan, where indigenous Baloch fear an influx of other ethnic groups and foreigners. Many residents say the pace of change is too slow. \"Local people are not completely satisfied,\" said Essar Nori, a lawmaker for Gwadar, adding that the separatists were tapping into that dissatisfaction. Pakistani officials are urging Gwadar residents to be patient, vowing to urgently build desalination plants and power stations. Cautionary tale Chinas Gwadar project contrasts with similar efforts in Sri Lanka, where the village of Hambantota was transformed into a port complex - but was saddled with Chinese debt. Last week, Sri Lanka formally handed over operations to China on a 99-year lease in exchange for lighter debt repayments, a move that sparked street protests over what many Sri Lankans view as an erosion of sovereignty. The Hambantota port, like Gwadar, is part of a network of harbours Beijing is developing in Asia and Africa that have spooked India, which fears being encircled by Chinas growing naval power. But Pakistani officials say comparisons to Hambantota are unfair because the Gwadar project has much less debt. On top of the airport, Chinese handouts in Gwadar include $100 million to expand a hospital by 250 beds, $130 million towards upgrading water infrastructure, and $10 million for a technical and vocational college, according to Pakistani government documents and officials. \"We welcome this assistance as its changing the quality of life of the people of Gwadar for the better,\" said Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of the parliamentary committee that oversees CPEC, including Gwadar. China and Pakistan jointly choose which projects will be developed under the CPEC mechanism, Sayed added. When China suggested a 7,000 metre runway for the new airport, Pakistan pushed for a 12,000 metre one that could accommodate planes as large as the Airbus 380 and be used for military purposes, according to Sajjad Baloch, a director of the Gwadar Development Authority. The scale of Chinese grants is extraordinary, according to Brad Parks, executive director of AidData, a research lab at the US-based William and Mary university that collected data on Chinese aid across 140 countries from 2000-2014. Since 2014, Beijing has pledged over $800 million in grants and concessional loans for Gwadar, which has less than 100,000 people. In the 15 years before that, China gave about $2.4 billion in concessional loans and grants during this period across the whole of Pakistan, a nation of 207 million people. \"Gwadar is exceptional even by the standards of Chinas past activities in Pakistan itself,\" Parks said. Hears and minds There are early signs Chinas efforts to win hearts and minds are beginning to bear fruit in Gwadar. \"Baluchistan is backward and underdeveloped, but we are seeing development after Chinas arrival,\" said Salam Dashti, 45, a grocer whose two children attend the new Chinese-built primary school. But there are major pitfalls ahead. Tens of thousands of people living by the port will have to be relocated. For now, they live in cramped single-story concrete houses corroded by sea water on a narrow peninsula, where barefoot fishermen offload their catch on newly-paved roads strewn with rubbish. Many of the fishermen say they fear theyll lose their livelihoods once the port starts operating. Indigenous residents fear of becoming a minority is inevitable with Gwadars population expected to jump more than 15-fold in coming decades. On the edge of town, mansions erected by land speculators are popping up alongside the sand dunes. Analysts say China is aware that previous efforts to develop Gwadar port failed partly due to the security threat posed by Baloch separatists, so Beijing is trying to counter the insurgents narrative that China wants to exploit Baluchistan. \"That weighs heavily on the minds of the Chinese,\" Parks added. \"Its almost certainly true that they are trying to safeguard their investments by getting more local buy-in.\" Chinese officials, meanwhile, are promoting the infrastructure development they are funding. \"Every day you can see new changes. It shows the sincerity of Chinese for development of Gwadar,\" Fijian Zhao, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Islamabad, tweeted last month. Naval facility For its investment in Gwadar, China will receive 91 percent of revenues until the port is returned to Pakistan in four decades time. The operator, China Overseas Ports Holding Company, will also be exempt from major taxes for more than 20 years. Pakistans maritime affairs minister, Hasil Bizenjo, said the arrival of the Chinese in the region contrasted with the experience of the past two centuries, when Russia and Britain, and later the United States and the Soviet Union, vied for control of the warm water ports of the Persian Gulf. \"The Chinese have come very smoothly, they have reached the warm waters,\" Bizenjo told Reuters. \"What they are investing is less than a peanut for access to warm waters.\" When a US Pentagon report in June suggested Gwadar could become a military base for China, a concern that India has also expressed, Beijing dismissed the idea. \"Talk that China is building a military base in Pakistan is pure guesswork,\" said a Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman, Wu Sian. Bizenjo and other Pakistani officials say Beijing has not asked to use Gwadar for naval purposes. \"This port, they will use it mostly for their commercial interests, but it depends on the next 20 years where the world goes,\" Bizenjo said.','WORLD-CHINA','','2017-12-17 19:12:00','Reuters | Updated: Dec 17, 2017, 19:12 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(918,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/top-polluter-china-unveils-nationwide-carbon-market/articleshow/62139940.cms','Top polluter China unveils nationwide carbon market','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62139939,width-400,resizemode-4/62139939.jpg]','BEIJING: China, the worlds biggest polluter, unveiled plans today for a national carbon market likely to become the worlds largest exchange for emissions credits. Environmentalists praised the move as an important step in the battle against climate change as China burns more coal than any other country, giving it the ignominious title of top greenhouse gas emitter. Although the long-delayed emissions exchange scheme will initially cover just the power generation sector, it is expected to surpass the European Unions carbon market, currently the worlds biggest. \"The purpose of this programme is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" said Zhang Yong, vice chairman of Chinas National Development and Reform Commission. The country is the largest investor in renewable energy but has faced an uphill battle transitioning from coal, which is used to generate roughly three-quarters of its power according to the International Energy Agency. China is seen as a potential leader in the fight against climate change after the US retreated from the Paris accord. \"The world has never before seen a climate programme on this scale,\" said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), which provided technical assistance to pilot carbon trading programmes in China. \"China has stepped up its climate leadership dramatically in recent years, and is now increasingly seen as filling the leadership void left by the US,\" Krupp said in a statement. The emission exchange outlined by the National Development and Reform Commission may slowly change the calculus for utilities and other coal-burners. \"We aim to reduce emissions through market-based mechanisms,\" Zhang said, adding that the immediate focus for establishing the carbon credits exchange is on the power generation industry. \"Some 1,700 electric companies emitted more than three billion tonnes of carbon,\" Zhang said. \"This is where we will get to it,\" he said, without giving more details, including the programmes timeline. The project expands on the lessons learned from seven provincial and city carbon exchanges. \"With just emissions trading in the power generation industry, the scale will exceed that of every country in the world,\" said Li Gao, an official in the commissions climate change department. Coal generates most of the nations power but the country has moved rapidly this winter to limit the dirty fuels use in northern China, though it had to reauthorise it in some areas due to natural gas shortages. EDF said Chinas power sector represents 39 percent of the nations total emissions. The EU Emissions Trading System puts a cap on the amount of carbon dioxide allowed to be emitted by large factories and other companies. The firms can trade in quotas of these emissions - the idea being to provide a carrot to improve energy efficiency or switch to cleaner sources so that they keep within the ceiling. But the EU last month agreed to reform the ETS as critics said the market, which covers about 40 per cent of Europes industrial emissions, has proven ineffective. Carbon allowances were too generous, resulting in a carbon price too low to encourage savings. Carbon Market Watch, which scrutinises such trading schemes, said a \"number of uncertainties remain\" around Chinas plan, including concerns over the quality of emissions data and the measuring, verification and reporting systems in many Chinese provinces. Nevertheless, Femke de Jong, policy director at Carbon Market Watch, said: \"The launch of the Chinese carbon market shows that there is increased commitment around the world to price pollution and direct investments into clean technologies.\"','WORLD-CHINA','','2017-12-19 22:36:00','AFP | Dec 19, 2017, 22:36 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(919,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/india-hits-out-at-china-pakistan-for-not-clearly-understanding-threat-of-terrorism/articleshow/62191677.cms','India hits out at China, Pakistan for not clearly understanding threat of terrorism','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62191700,width-400,resizemode-4/62191700.jpg]','UNITED NATIONS: India has hit out at some UN members for failing to \"clearly understand\" the common threat of terrorism due to their \"narrow political and strategic concerns\", apparently referring to Pakistan and China.

Akbaruddin was apparently referring to Chinas decision to repeatedly block a move by India to designate Masood Azhar, chief of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) militant group, as a global terrorist. On an issue as serious as designation of terrorist individuals and entities, the Council-mandated Sanctions Committees fail to make concrete progress and fall victim to \"narrow political and strategic concerns in some cases\", he said. Akbaruddin also referred to the fact that the UN-designated terrorist and Mumbai attack mastermind, Hafiz Saeed, was seeking to contest elections in Pakistan. Saeed had announced that his Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) will contest the 2018 general elections in Pakistan under the banner of the Milli Muslim League, which is yet to be registered with the Election Commission. \"In other cases where Sanctions Committees have designated terrorists, there are states who venture to mainstream UN designated terrorist individuals into their political process in total disregard of international law, thus putting our common security in peril,\" Akbaruddin said in his address to the Security Council.','WORLD-CHINA','','2017-12-21 13:43:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 21, 2017, 13:43 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(920,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/lessons-should-be-learnt-from-doklam-standoff-china/articleshow/62133910.cms','Lessons should be learnt from Doklam standoff: China','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62133911,width-400,resizemode-4/62133911.jpg]','BEIJING: China today said that the Doklam standoff posed a \"major test\" for the bilateral ties+ and lessons should be learnt from it to avoid a similar situation of its kind in the future. The comment came ahead of the 20th round of India-China border talks which are expected to be held this week in New Delhi between National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval and Chinas State Councillor Yang Jiechi who are designated special representatives. Though the talks are scheduled for December 22, an official announcement has not been made yet from both sides. Read also: Why Doklam matters to India The two sides attach significance to this round of talks as it would be the first round of talks since the 73-day Doklam standoff in the Sikkim section which ended on August 28. \"This special representative meeting is not only a high- level channel for the border issue discussion but also the platform for strategic communication,\" Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing here today. This also allows the two sides to exchange views on the international and regional issues of major concern, she said. \"In 2017, China-India relations have maintained a good momentum generally but the Doklam incident posed a major test for the two countries. We should learn lessons from this incident to avoid any further conflict of this kind in the future,\" Hua said. \"We should follow our historical conventions on the border to uphold the tranquillity and peace in the border region as well as safeguard the larger picture of the India-China relations,\" she said, adding that is in the best interest of both the countries. Asked about the Doklam standoffs impact on the talks, Hua said the issue also figured in the recent visit of foreign minister Wang Yi to New Delhi to take part in the foreign ministers meeting of Russia, India, China (RIC). On its sidelines, Wang also held talks with his Indian counterpart Sushma Swaraj and President Ram Nath Kovind. Wang in his meeting with Indian counterpart also touched about the Doklam issue, Hua said. Besides attempting to resolve the vexed border dispute, the format of the India-China Special Representatives talks covered the whole gamut of relations between the two countries including political, strategic, economic and trade issues. The 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) covers from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh. Of this, 220-km section falls in Sikkim. The two sides so far held 19 rounds of special representatives talks to resolve the dispute. Officials say Wangs visit, the first by a top Chinese official after the Doklam standoff and the starting of second term of Chinese President Xi Jinping in October facilitated a more candid and frank talks between the two countries to tide over most contentious between the two countries beyond the diplomatic niceties. They said though a solution to the border dispute still eludes the two countries, a lot of headway has been made in the 19th round of talks in terms of working out mechanisms to restore peace and tranquillity along the border to resolve tensions out of the aggressive patrolling by troops. The Doklam standoff began on June 16 over PLAs plans to build a road in area claimed by Bhutan after the Indian troops intervened to stop it as it posed a security risk to Chicken Neck, the narrow corridor connecting India with its North-eastern states. India pointed Sino-Indian differences over the tri-junction between India, China and Bhutan in the Sikkim section which is yet to be settled. The standoff ended on August 28 following mutual agreement between India and China. China, which earlier opened the Nathu La route for Indian pilgrims to visit Kailash and Manasarovar, has closed it after the Doklam standoff and yet to open it.','WORLD-CHINA','','2017-12-19 18:27:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 19, 2017, 18:27 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(921,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/lizard-turtle-among-more-than-100-new-species-found-in-mekong-region/articleshow/62133686.cms','Lizard, turtle among more than 100 new species found in Mekong region','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62133724,width-400,resizemode-4/62133724.jpg]','BANGKOK: A Vietnamese crocodile lizard and a Thai turtle found on sale in a local market are among more than 100 new species discovered in the ecologically diverse but threatened Mekong region last year, researchers said Tuesday. The Southeast Asian countries flanking the Mekong river, which snakes down from the Tibetan plateau to the South China Sea, are among the most biodiverse in the world. Each year, scientists announce scores of new species discovered in the region, which includes Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. But there are fears that many more species could die out before they are found in a region whose jungle and river ecosystems are increasingly threatened by roads, dams and a thriving illegal wildlife trade. In total, scientists confirmed 115 new species in 2016 after a lengthy vetting process, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). They include 11 amphibians, two fish, 11 reptiles, 88 plants and three mammals. \"While the global trends are worrisome, and the threats against species and their habitats here in the Greater Mekong are massive, these new species discoveries give us enormous hope,\" said WWFs Lee Poston. \"But we have to do more to protect their habitat and prevent them from entering the illegal wildlife trade,\" he added. The new finds include a bat with a horseshoe-shaped face and a snail-eating turtle discovered by a scientists in a local market in northeastern Thailand. The Crocodile Lizard, a scaly reptile that hails from northern Vietnams evergreen forests, was also among the new species announced on Tuesday. Although the reptile was first discovered in 2003, it has taken years to confirm its status as a separate subspecies. Coal mining and pet trade poachers have gravely endangered the lizard, whose numbers are estimated to be fewer than 200, scientists said. Two new mole species were also found in Vietnam, with researchers noting that their underground dwellings have helped protect them. Over the past 20 years more than 2,500 new species -- amounting to around two per week -- have been discovered in the Greater Mekong, WWF said.','HOME-ENVIRONMENT','','2017-12-19 15:32:00','AFP | Dec 19, 2017, 15:32 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(922,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/pollution/green-nod-must-for-realty-projects-ngt/articleshow/62201261.cms','Green nod must for realty projects: NGT','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62201271,width-400,resizemode-4/62201271.jpg]','NEW DELHI: The National Green Tribunal has shelved Delhi Development Authoritys new building bylaws which exempt realty projects from undergoing environment impact assessment (EIA). In a detailed judgment dated December 8, published on Wednesday, NGT also stayed the Union environment ministrys notification of December 9 which exempted real-estate projects (up to 1,50,000 sq m built-up area) in the country from undergoing EIA and obtaining environmental clearance (EC). Aimed at ease of doing business, the ministrys notification had entrusted the monitoring of environment parameters of realty projects to urban local bodies which also sanction these projects. DDA was the first agency in the country to incorporate the new guidelines in the environment ministrys December 9 notification, even before the final notification was issued. The environment ministry in its notification had also said that \"consent to establish\" and \"consent to operate\" under the provisions of the Air Act 1981 and the Water Act 1974 will not be required anymore from the state pollution control boards for large building projects. The notification was challenged by a group of petitioners in NGT on various grounds, including the reason for exemption being \"ease of doing responsible business\". They said ease of doing business cannot be a ground for exempting the application of environmental law. RTI responses had earlier cited a letter from then urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu to former environment minister Prakash Javadekar in which Naidu wrote that integrating environmental clearances with the permission to construct buildings was a \"landmark step in ease of doing business.\" The environment ministry had justified the notification in the light of the governments objective of \"providing houses for all by 2022 with an objective of making available affordable housing to weaker sections in urban areas\". In a strongly worded judgment - one of the last passed by former NGT chairperson Swatanter Kumar before he retired on Wednesday - the bench said: \"Ease of doing responsible business cannot be in fact and in law the ground for making amendment to the environmental laws, as it primarily falls beyond the scope of the object and purposes of the environmental laws in force. It is only a ploy to circumvent the provisions of the environmental assessment.\" It noted that the environment ministrys notification ignores the evaluation, assessment or monitoring of the environment impact of the building and construction activity. \"The construction industry consumes enormous resources and has a significant energy footprint; the sector emits 22% of Indias total annual carbon dioxide emissions,\" it stated. Invoking the Paris agreement on climate change, the bench also referred to international law principle of non-regression and said environmental laws cannot be modified to weaken them. \"Under international law, the doctrine of non-regression is an accepted norm. It is founded on the idea that environmental law should not be modified to the detriment of environmental protection. This principle needs to be brought into play because today environmental law is facing a number of threats such as deregulation, a movement to simplify...\" NGT also pointed to the conflict of interest in entrusting the job of monitoring environmental parameters to local bodies. \"The local authorities which are the sanctioning authorities would also become adjudicatory authorities under the impugned notification.

The taskforce, formed under the Centre-notified Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), made the recommendation to the EPCA as part of a series of proposals in light of pollution touching emergency level again. The ASEAN summit is scheduled to take place between January 19 and 30 in the national capital. The EPCA (Environment Pollution - Prevention and Control Authority) also wrote to the chief secretaries of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to gear up for another round of action under the emergency category of the GRAP, which includes the odd-even scheme. The CPCB taskforce, after reviewing the situation, also recommended that the states show readiness for implementing the road-rationing scheme for private vehicle except emergency services. Health expert T K Joshi, a member of the taskforce, told PTI that recommending closure of the coal-based thermal power plants in the region was also on the table but a decision was put off for the time being as it may be counterproductive. \"It may lead to a power crisis and subsequently may trigger large-scale use of diesel-generator sets which are already banned. We will constantly review the situation, which may persist for a few more days,\" Joshi said. At 2 pm today, the concentration of PM2.5 was 320.9 microgram per cubic metre (ug/m3), while PM10 was 496 ug/m3, four units short of the emergency limit of 500 ug/m3. At 6 pm, the corresponding readings were 314 and 487 ug/m3. Under the Centre-notified Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), pollution is considered severe plus or emergency when readings of ultrafine particulates PM2.5 or PM10 are above 300 and 500 ug/m3 respectively. Measures listed under the emergency category are rolled out when these conditions prevail for 48 hours at a stretch. \"Task Force reviewed air quality situation for Delhi NCR. Continuous Severe + air quality is noted since 0700 Hrs (December 21, 2017) and IMD has forecast low winds and moderate/dense fog in morning,\" as per the minutes of the meeting. If the EPCA notifies the emergency action plan, which was done during the November smog episode, measures including a ban on entry of trucks, construction activities and the odd- even scheme may have to be enforced in the city. In the first round, these measures were imposed on November 8 and withdrawn on November 16 after the smog lifted. The latest spell of pollution started on the night of December 19. Since then, the pollution graph has steadily risen, mainly due to a drastic fall in wind speed which is preventing dispersion of pollutants.','HOME-ENVIRONMENT','','2017-12-21 22:51:00','PTI | Dec 21, 2017, 22:51 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(924,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/olive-ridley-sea-turtle-without-left-flippers-rescued-in-tn/articleshow/62181336.cms','Olive Ridley sea turtle without left flippers rescued in TN','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62181365,width-400,resizemode-4/62181365.jpg]','MADURAI: Wildlife officials rescued an Olive Ridley sea turtle at Pirappanvalasai in Ramanathapuram district of Tamil Nadu on Wednesday.

Since the turtle cant be released back to sea in that condition, officials handed it over to the Centre for Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) at Mandapam where it will be reared in an aquarium. As turtle nesting season began, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park started deploying members of local community as anti-poaching watchers. On Wednesday morning, the anti-poaching watchers alerted Mandapam wildlife officials about a turtle at Pirappanvalasai. Officials reached the spot found that it was an Olive Ridley. \"As the turtle didnt have right side flippers, it did not have much chance of surviving if we released it back to sea. So we approached the CMFRI for help, and CMFRI officials agreed to take it in their aquarium,\" wildlife ranger S Sathish said. The CMFRI maintains an aquarium on marine eco-system to educate visiting students. There are green turtles in the CMFRI. This Olive Ridley will be an addition there. \"It may live some more years in an aquarium than in sea as it has no right flippers,\" Sathish said. Turtles are a protected marine species under the Wildlife Protection Act, and prolonged conservation efforts dissuade fishermen from poaching them for meat. However, the turtles do get caught in fishing nets. Fearing punishment, fishermen throw them back to sea. \"Fishermen dont exercise caution when they remove such marine species from nets resulting in serious injuries to turtles. They include flipper damage,\" a forest official said. In the last six months, wildlife officials recovered five to six turtles washing ashore dead without flippers. The department has been trying in vain to persuade fishermen to use turtle excluder device in their nets.

Sharing documentary evidence with the parliamentary Committee on Petitions, the groups, in their submission noted that majority of compensatory afforestation (CA) across 10 states was done on forest land instead of non-forest land in clear violation of guidelines under the Forest Conservation (FC) Act, 1980. Compensatory afforestation under the FC Act must be undertaken on non-forest land in the same district where the forest was diverted for non-forestry purposes like mining, dams, industrial and infrastructural projects. \"About 70% of recently undertaken CA has either been done on forest land, when it is meant to be undertaken on non-forest land, or on ancestral community lands of particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs),\" said the petition. It has taken note of a recent ground level study on the CAF plantations and claimed that the Act even does not have provisions to comply with the Forest Rights Act (FRA) to safeguard the rights of tribal and other traditional forest dwellers. Since the CAF Act doesnt comply with the provisions of the FRA, the forest officials rarely consult Gram Sabhas for carrying out afforestation programmes. The study, which the petition referred to, said, \"Out of the 52 villages (in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha), the forest department sought the consent of Gram Sabhas in only two villages, thereby completely violating the Forest Rights Act.\" The study was released by the Community Forest Rights-Learning and Advocacy (CFR-LA) - a group of grassroot organizations, researchers and academicians - last month. The study was based on an analysis of 2,479 CA plantations in 10 states. Noting the discrepancies, the forest rights groups through their petition also demanded that all accumulated compensatory afforestation funds (over Rs 42,000 crore) must be democratically managed and administered by transferring it to Gram Sabhas and all those evicted and/or relocated for CA plantations must be compensated. The petition also raised concerns about the new guideline of the environment ministry for creating land banks for CA and demanded its immediate withdrawal. The ministry had last month asked states and UTs to create land bank for afforestation as itll help speedy disposal of forest clearance proposals.','HOME-ENVIRONMENT','Vishwa Mohan','2017-12-17 21:37:00','| TNN | Updated: Dec 17, 2017, 21:37 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(927,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/top-five-fastest-centuries-in-twenty20-internationals/articleshow/62219831.cms','Top five fastest centuries in Twenty20 Internationals','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62219925,width-400,resizemode-4/62219925.jpg, https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/img/62221099/Master.jpg]','Rohit Sharma on Friday equalled the record for the quickest century in T20Is when he blazed to a 35-ball 100 against Sri Lanka in Indore. Two months ago, it was David Miller who first set the mark against Bangladesh. Heres a look at the top-five quickest centuries in Twenty20 Internationals till date. David Miller (vs Bangladesh in Potchefstroom) & Rohit Sharma (vs Sri Lanka in Indore) [35 balls] David Miller broke his countryman Richard Levis record of fastest hundred set five years ago when he went hammers and tongs against Bangladesh in Potchefstroom. He came in to bat at the end of the 10th over after South Africa batted first in the second and final T20I against Bangladesh. He was dropped when yet to open his account and Miller went berserk afterwards, smashing the ball all around the park. It was his maiden T20I hundred and the highlight of his assault was the penultimate over, bowled by Mohammad Saifuddin in which he clobbered five consecutive sixes. With seven fours and nine sixes, Miller recorded the fastest century in T20Is and remained unbeaten on 101 off 36. Within two months of his feat, Indias Rohit Sharma equalled the record for the quickest ton in the format against Sri Lanka in Indore. Batting first, Rohit leading India in the absence of regular captain Virat Kohli, made a mockery of the Sri Lanka attack, hitting boundaries after boundaries with ridiculous ease. In doing so, he also recorded the fastest ton by an Indian across formats and became the first from his country to score two centuries in T20Is. It came days after he had scored his third double-century in One Day Internationals. When Rohit finally got out, he had plundered 118 off 43 balls with the help of 12 fours and 10 sixes. Richard Levi (45 balls vs New Zealand in Hamilton) In front of a sold-out Seddon Park, South African Richard Levi announced himself to the world in style, cracking the then fastest T20I hundred off just 46 deliveries. The burly opener, playing in his second T20I, achieved the record while leading a successful run chase of 173 against New Zealand. He opened his account with a quick single and gave an early sample of his prowess with a six that was the result of a top-edge. His first fifty came in 25 balls and for his next he took just 20. Levi reserved special treatment for pacer Doug Bracewell off whom he scored 34 runs including five sixes. It was his belligerence that enabled South Africa to chase down the target with 24 balls remaining. Levi remained unbeaten on 117, hitting five fours and a record 13 sixes during his knock. Faf du Plessis (vs West Indies in Johannesburg) & KL Rahul (vs West Indies, Lauderhill) [46 balls] Captain Faf du Plessis walked in at no 3 after South Africa batted first at the Wanderers against West Indies. After South Africa were given early jolts, Du Plessis resurrected the innings en route to his century. In the final over of the Powerplay, he clobbered Sulieman Benn for 20 runs in six deliveries that included a hat-trick of fours and a six. A six over midwicket took him to his half-century. And a four to his century and he thus became the second centurion from his country in the format. Before Holder finally removed him, Plessis had scored 119 runs in SAs total of 231/7. Against West Indies at Lauderhill, KL Rahul became the third Indian batsman after Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma to hit a T20I ton. He recorded an unbeaten maiden century off 46 deliveries - then joint second-fastest in the format - battling pain and nerves to push India on the brink of completing the highest ever successful run-chase in T20Is. India were chasing a massive 246 but Rahul hit 12 fours and five sixes to give hopes to the Indian fans. The contest was a run-fest with Evin Lewis of West Indies scoring a hundred himself earlier. In their chase, India lost two early wickets before Rahul walked in at no. 4 and reignited the chase with an unbeaten 51-ball 110. Aaron Finch (vs England in Southampton) & Chris Gayle (vs England in Mumbai) [47 balls] Chris Gayle scythed through the English attack in West Indies opening match of the 2016 WT20 to take them to a six-wicket win in the Super 10s. Chasing 183, West Indies lost David Willey for a duck. Gayle, unfazed, warmed up with a drive over mid-off for a four followed by a six straight over the bowlers head. Two consecutive sixes off legspinner Adil Rashid in the ninth marked the start of a brutal assault. Ben Stokes came charging in and the Six-Machine deposited him twice over deep square leg boundary. Moeen Alis final three deliveries were deposited into the stands for three sixes. Gayles fifty came in 27 balls and his 100 came off 47 and thus broke his own record of the fastest hundred in World T20s. Australia opener Aaron Finch toyed with the England bowlers to post the highest ever individual score in T20Is in Southampton after being put in to bat. He set the tone with a six off the first ball, bowled by Steven Finn whom he milked for three more fours in the coming overs as Australia scored 58/1 in the Powerplay. A six off Ravi Bopara took him to 55 in 26 deliveries. And in the next 11 deliveries, sprinted to his maiden century. He wasnt done yet as he continued to crush England bowlers and eventually scored 156 off just 63 balls with 11 boundaries and record 15 sixes. This continues to be the highest score by a batsman in T2oIs. Evin Lewis (48 balls vs India in Lauderhill) In a run-fest that saw 489 runs scored across 40 overs, Evin Lewis scored one of the two centuries of the contest. Against India at Lauderhill, Lewis was playing in only his second T20I and had come in as replacement of Gayle. And what a decision it turned out to be as together with Johnson Charles (79), he provided the American crowd a sumptuous treat. He was in a destructive mood, scoring five fours and nine sixes before getting out on 100. It took him just 48 deliveries to score a maiden international hundred. He was particularly in a punishing mood against Stuart Binny whom he hit for five sixes in one over. West Indies scored 245 before Dwayne Bravo held his nerves to seal a thrilling one run win.','SPORTS-CRICKET','','2017-12-23 19:31:00','TIMESOFINDIA.COM | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 19:31 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(928,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/golf/top-stories/woods-splits-with-swing-coach-como/articleshow/62217336.cms','Woods splits with swing coach Como','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62217322,width-400,resizemode-4/62217322.jpg]','LOS ANGELES: Tiger Woods will press on with his comeback in 2018 without the aid of a swing coach, announcing on Twitter on Friday that he is splitting with Chris Como.

Suarez capitalised on wide open space in Madrids midfield to knock in a simple pass from Sergi Roberto following a breakaway move in the 54th minute. That opened the scoring after a tense but tight first half in the early afternoon sun at the Santiago Bernabeu. Messi hammered in the second goal from the penalty spot 20 minutes later after Dani Carvajal was sent off for blocking a goal-bound header from Paulinho with his arm after Real were again easily picked apart on the counter attack. Catalan defender turned winger Vidal hit the third in injury time to pile more misery on Madrid, who looked unrecognisable from the side who crushed Barca 5-1 on aggregate in the Spanish Super Cup in August. Real failed to capitalise on their chances in the first half as Karim Benzemas header came off the post and Cristiano Ronaldo was denied by the flailing leg of Barca goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. However, the European and Liga champions collapsed after the interval and Barca took full advantage. Barca are nine points clear of nearest challengers Atletico Madrid at the top of the standings although Valencia could climb to second and close the gap to eight points later on Saturday if they beat Villarreal. Real are 14 points adrift but have a game in hand. Instead of the usual late evening kickoff time, Spains premier club fixture took place at 1200 GMT in a bid to capture a record television audience in Asia. It was also played in the backdrop of a political crisis in the country, coming two days after elections in Catalonia in which separatist parties won a majority. Reals supporters unfurled a giant banner before kickoff to boast of the unprecedented five trophies the team had won in 2017. The volume in the packed Bernabeu was cranked up when Ronaldo headed a corner in off the crossbar in under two minutes but the offside flag halted the premature celebrations. Barca, the only unbeaten team in the league, took a less active role than they have in recent games at the Bernabeu, with their best chances before the break falling to Brazilian midfielder Paulinho. They created a number of opportunities after the interval, however, and could have punished Real even further than they did.','SPORTS-FOOTBALL','','2017-12-23 21:04:00','Reuters | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 21:04 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(930,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/bcci-appoints-saba-karim-as-gm-of-cricket-operations/articleshow/62220096.cms','BCCI appoints Saba Karim as GM of Cricket Operations','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62220177,width-400,resizemode-4/62220177.jpg]','NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Saturday announced the appointment of former India wicketkeeper-batsman Saba Karim as the new General Manager (GM) of its Cricket Operations.

Rohits brief tenure as stand-in captain will come to an end with the final T20 International against Sri Lanka on Sunday as Virat Kohli will be back in the hot seat for the South Africa tour after a month-long break. \"Since I am leading the side for the first time, there was pressure and there will be pressure when we play next match in Mumbai. I dont know when will I captain the side again, so every minute spent on ground is important for me,\" a pragmatic Rohit said after hitting the record equalling 35-ball hundred in the second T20 International against Sri Lanka. He has led Mumbai Indians to IPL treble but this stint has made Rohit realise how tough it is to captain the national team with the burden of expectations from billions of people. \"There is lot of pressure, especially after first match in Dharamsala. We were in such a position that we were on the verge of getting all out on our lowest score,\" he said. \"I thought a lot about my captaincy and team and that it is very difficult. We are representing 140 crore people and there is lot of pressure of that,\" he said. Its not brute power but sublime timing with which Rohit produces his big hundreds and his ability to play according to the field has been the key to his batting. \"I definitely dont have so much power. I rely a lot on timing the ball more than anything else. I know what my strengths are as well as my weaknesses. I try to play to the field as much as I can, to be honest,\" said Rohit. He clears the boundary ropes with consummate ease, in complete contrast to modern days aggressive batsmen such as Chris Gayle, who rely on power hitting. Yet he is the only batsman, who has three double hundreds in ODIs and now two in the Twenty20 format. Asked if he makes any technical adjustment to hit the big shots, Rohit explained his strategy. \"The field is spread after six overs. I try and see where I can find my boundary options. Its important to be able to play with the field,\" he said. \"I want to score all around the park and not just one area. Its important to explore the fielding the opposition keeps for me. \"In all formats, I try to do that. You cant just hit in one area, you become predictable then. Its always important to score runs all over the field and thats my strength.\" The way he was mauling the Lankan attack, a double hundred in T20 was a possibility. However, Rohit said he did not think of double century. \"Not really. I was just thinking to score runs. I wasnt thinking of any particular target. In all the formats, I dont look to score runs to get to a particular milestone,\" he said. \"My job is to go out there and score as many (runs) as possible. Not just 100s or 200s or 300s. I go out there to make sure I get my team into a good position. \"There are times when you dont get runs. There are times when you get runs. That is all part and parcel of the game. Never do I ever walk out thinking that I want to score a century or a double century. I just want to give my best and get the team a victory,\" he said. During his sensational 118-run knock off just 43 balls, Rohit hit 10 sixes and 12 boundaries. Asked if he surprised himself with any one particular shot, Rohit replied in a negative. \"I dont play any of those flamboyant shots. I just try to hit the ball in the area I look to hit. All the shots please me since it takes a lot to pull that off,\" he said. \"Even when you defend you should like that as well. Its not just about hitting boundaries and sixes even the ball hit in the gap should make you more happy,\" he said.','SPORTS-CRICKET','','2017-12-23 16:47:00','PTI | Dec 23, 2017, 16:47 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(932,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/badminton/warriors-shock-defending-champions-smashers-in-pbl-opener/articleshow/62225510.cms','Warriors shock defending champions Smashers in PBL opener','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62225537,width-400,resizemode-4/62225537.jpg]','GUWAHATI: Awadhe Warriors overcame the last-minute pullout of star player Saina Nehwal owing to an injury, as they stunned defending champions Chennai Smashers in the Premier Badminton League (PBL) opener on Saturday. Awadhe won both their mens singles and mixed doubles to take an unassailable 3-0 lead (4-0 on points) in the five-match duel at the Karmabir Nabin Chandra Bordoloi Indoor Stadium. World No. 3 Kidambi Srikanth downed Frenchman Brice Leverdez 15-12, 15-14 to build upon the successes of Parupalli Kashyap and the mixed doubles pair of Christinna Pedersen and Tang Chun Man earllier. The resilient Frenchman stretched Srikanth in both the games but the Indian closed out the second via sudden death after they were tied 14-all. Kashyap won his singles against Daniel S Farid 15-12, 15-8 to give them an additional advantage as Awadhe had ticked this encounter as their Trump Match. The victory gave them two points as against the usual one point for a win. Kashyap dominated the encounter and sealed the contest in straight games. Earlier, Christinna and Tang provided an ideal start to Awadhes campaign by shocking fancied English couple Chris and Gabrielle Adcock 10-15, 15-5, 15-12. The world No 9 Adcocks started off well by pocketing the first game but the Danish girl Christinna and Hong Kongs Tang fought back brilliantly to turn the tables on the English pair. Their successes were roundly cheered by Saina from the bench after she was ruled out with an ankle niggle from the high-voltage meeting against Sindhu. Awadhe coach Anup Sridhar, however, was hopeful Saina will turn out at the Siri Fort Sports Complex in New Delhi for their second match against North East Warriors on December 30. Sridhar, who alongwith Siyadath Ullah are part of the Awadhe coaching setup, said in a statement: \"Saina is recovering from a small ankle issue which she had developed few weeks back. She is recovering well and we are expecting her to be fully fit for the next match.\" The Saina-Sindhu meeting cannot be ruled out completely as both teams can still face off in the semi-final or final.

Asked if they are looking at Dhoni on a series by series basis, Prasad said: \"We are grooming some wicketkeepers during India A tours. But more or less, we have fixed up (our) minds till the World Cup (on continuing with Dhoni) and after that at later stages we will start grooming some of those (wicket- keepers).\" \"I think MS Dhoni still remains the No 1 wicket-keeper in the world and day in and day out we have been saying this.

What Prasad said after that would be pretty disturbing for the likes of Pant and Sanju Samson, who are next in line. \"Let me tell you frankly, those boys still are not up to the level as what we would have expected.

It marked a sixth game unbeaten for Everton under former England boss Allardyce, but Chelseas failure to convert possession into goals will not have pleased Blues manager Antonio Conte. Conte has already conceded his inconsistent team wont be able to defend the Premier League title and this was another frustrating afternoon for the Italian as the Blues squandered their territorial dominance. Chelsea remain third and are 13 points behind leaders Manchester City, who play Bournemouth later on Saturday. Initially, it looked like being an encouraging day for Conte as Chelsea quickly established a pattern of complete dominance. It took an impressive double goal-line clearance by veteran defender Phil Jagielka to deny the visitors what would have been a deserved lead. The Everton captain read the situation perfectly as Marcos Alonsos cross flew through the home area after 10 minutes, reacting sharply to block Tiemoue Bakayokos effort. Jagielka then responded even more impressively as Willian looked certain to convert the rebound, the defender positioning himself to keep out the follow-up effort in similar fashion. Yet for all their superiority in those opening stages, Chelsea struggled to carve out many meaningful chances to trouble home keeper Jordan Pickford. After 20 minutes, Cuco Martina was booked for a blatant foul on Victor Moses on the edge of the Everton area but Willian sent his free-kick sailing well over. And while the passing and movement of Willian, Pedro and Eden Hazard was pleasing on the eye and threatening at times, Everton stuck to their defensive duties well. It was easy to see the impact Allardyce has made since his arrival at Goodison Park although Everton were not helped by the pre-match loss of in-form Wayne Rooney due to illness. In the absence of the 10-goal forward, Evertons attacking play was likely to be hindered and so it proved, with Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois a virtual spectator. A promising counter-attack, just after the half-hour, ended with Morgan Schneiderlin sending away Tom Davies but his strike from 25 yards was always drifting away from goal. And before the interval, Dominic Calvert-Lewin showed great persistence to strip Andreas Christiansen of the ball and advance into the area where his shot was blocked by Antonio Rudiger. But Chelsea responded in kind when Bakayoko broke up an Everton attack on the halfway line before playing Pedro clear for a powerful shot which drew a spectacular one-handed save from Pickford. Allardyce made a major reshuffle at the interval, bringing on Sandro and Ashley Williams as he switched to three central defenders, a move that proved something of a gamble when he lost Idrissa Gueye to injury within five minutes of the restart and was forced to use his final substitute. By then, Chelsea had already threatened Pickfords goal, with the keeper saving well from Pedros drive before Williams did well to block Alonsos effort. There was some anxiety for the visitors when Hazard was hacked down and required lengthy treatment, with Michael Keane booked for the foul. But the Belgian quickly shook off the effects of the injury and was soon forcing Pickford into another fine diving save after receiving a pass from Willian. Williams got his head to Victor Moses fierce 75th minute cross, deflecting it onto the Everton bar before it flew out of harms way. There was also a late chance for substitute Cesc Fabregas when Jagielka stuck out a foot and deflected his powerful, long-range shot just wide.','SPORTS-FOOTBALL','','2017-12-23 21:08:00','AFP | Dec 23, 2017, 21:08 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(936,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-pune-city-storm-into-top-four-with-win-over-goa/articleshow/62224118.cms','ISL: Pune City storm into top four with win over Goa','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62224114,width-400,resizemode-4/62224114.jpg]','MARGAO: FC Pune City leaped into fourth place after a stunning 2-0 win over table-toppers FC Goa in the Indian Super League (ISL) on Saturday. By dishing out another impressive counter-attacking performance, they snapped the home sides streak of three consecutive wins. It looked like both teams would cancel each other out until the 72nd minute when Marcelinho threaded a pass forward for Emiliano Alfaro, who clinically buried it past Laxmikant Kattimani. Alfaro had a chance to double the lead two minutes later but his shot didnt have enough pace and was cleared away. However, Pune finally had their second goal in the 84th minute when Jonatan Lucca gleefully converted after Mandar Rao Dessais clearance deflected into his path. Despite having the better first half, Pune had to work hard and dig deep at times with Goa coming at them in full force in the second period. This was exemplified with Vishal Kaiths triple save in the 70th minute, when he saved shots from Ferran Corominas, Brandon Fernandes and Manuel Arana as chaos ensued in the Pune box. Apart from setting up the first goal, Marcelinho was heavily involved in the game, his swept effort and a ballooned shot coming seconds apart from each other in the 50th minute. But he was also in the middle of a penalty shout which the referee waved away. But while they have the attacking verve, Pune won this game on the merit of sitting deep and defending smartly. They had to soak in a lot of pressure in the first 10 minutes of the match after Mandar and Brandon both got into dangerous areas only to see their shots blocked. It was interesting for Goa to try the long-ball tactic early on, but Punes defenders held tight and defended with ease. But after that cagey start, the game suddenly opened up when Corominas dinked the ball over goalkeeper Kaith, but his attempt clipped the woodwork as the first notable warning shot was fired by the home side. Pune had a glorious chance themselves. Marcelinho was the architect with some incredibly individual ability, setting up Alfaro to tap in, which the striker somehow missed in front of an open net. With frustration setting in for Alfaro, he struck from distance, but his blistering shot was palmed away by Laxmikant Kattimani. Diego Carlos and Manuel Lanzarote then carved out two half chances, but both went begging as some good goalkeeping and profligacy in front of the net meant the score stayed 0-0 at the break. The game had to come to life at some point, and when it did, Goa looked out of ideas going forward, allowing Pune to hit them on the break and take a valuable three away points.

The 32-year-old Olympic bronze medallist has so far enjoyed a great run in the professional career, winning all his nine fights, and tonight was no different at a jam-packed Sawai Mansingh Stadium as he emerged as the king of Rumble Rajasthan. It was very cautious first round from both, and barring a few jabs here and there, both tried to read each others styles. Vijender seemed to have found his bearing only when the sixth round started. He landed some real hard punches on Amuzus rib- cage to take control of the bout. Amuzu returned the favour with a few of his own, but the West African Boxing Union Middleweight champion could not sustain the tempo against his determined Indian opponent. A confident Vijender then turned up with renewed vigour to unleash a flurry of punches on Amuzu. Two powerful jabs on Amuzus jawline must have hurt the African, but he retaliated with a hook aiming at Vijenders head. It was easy picking for Vijender thereafter as the Amuzu committed technical blunders by rushing to the corners. With Vijender having the upper hand, a tired Amuzu tried to stage a fightback but the Indian was up to the task, even as the duo exchanged a few punches. Vijender played a percentage game during the final round when he had already suffered a muscle pull and didnt attack a lot.

There have been reports that shooting would not be included in the Birmingham Games programme though some media outlets said such a decision is not yet finalised. Shooting is an optional sport and is not among the 10 core sports which are mandatory in every Commonwealth Games. A host country can include up to seven from a list of optional sports/disciplines. It has been contested at every Commonwealth Games since Kingston 1966, with the exception of Edinburgh 1970. India are among the top performing countries in shooting in the Commonwealth Games. The country is currently second on the all-time medal table having won 56 gold, 40 silver and 22 bronze. Reacting to the development, IOA Secretary General Rajeev Mehta said, \"We have not yet received any official communication from the 2022 CWG organisers or the CGF about this. So I cannot say with certainty (that shooting has been scrapped). \"We will take it up with the organisers and the CGF and present our objection if such a decision (to scrap shooting) is taken,\" he said. The International Shooting Sport Federation and British Shooting had both claimed earlier this year that the sport should be contested at the 2022 Games. But shootings inclusion in the Birmingham Games has been uncertain from the very beginning as the closest Olympic- standard range to the Midlands city is more than 200km away at Bisley in Surrey. In fact, on the representation of National Rifles Association of India (NRAI), the IOA had written a letter to the CGF President Louise Martin in September, asking the organisers to include shooting in their programme. \"Shooting has been part of Commonwealth Games since 1966 and Commonwealth Shooting Championship is organised regularly. It is a popular sport with many medallist in the Commonwealth countries, including India, Australia, England, Canada, New Zealand ... The exclusion of shooting from the sports programme of 2022 CWG is not at all conceivable,\" the letter by Mehta said. \"As for India, our shooters have won a number of medals in the Commonwealth Games. The victory in the CWG has been a catalyst in the development of shooting in our country. It is significant in our review of sporting performance. \"The IOA-CGA India strongly recommends to the executive board of the CGF and also Commonwealth Games England for continuity and inclusion of shooting in 2022 CWG,\" the letter had stated. However, lack of facilities has not deterred the 2022 CWG organisers from staging track cycling at the Lee Valley Velodrome in London -- the venue used at the 2012 Olympic Games -- which is also more than 200km away from Birmingham. With the building of a new velodrome in Birmingham not feasible due to time constraints and financial concerns, organisers have decided to stage the event at the venue located at the Queen Elizabeth Park in London.','SPORTS-MORE-SPORTS','','2017-12-23 17:36:00','PTI | Dec 23, 2017, 17:36 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(939,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/u-19-world-cup/respect-opportunity-you-are-getting-virat-kohlis-tips-for-u-19s/articleshow/62221225.cms','Respect opportunity you are getting: Virat Kohlis tips for U-19s','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62221231,width-400,resizemode-4/62221231.jpg]','DUBAI: He knows the value that a platform like ICC U-19 World Cup provides and no wonder India captain Virat Kohli urged the current crop of India colts to \"respect the opportunity\" that they are getting.

Playing international cricket within your age group allows players to see slightly higher standards, the best of the best from the under-19 perspective, so (it is) a great tournament to be involved in.\" The New Zealand skipper feels that since the U-19 World Cup happens once in every two years, youngsters should grab the opportunity as there are no guarantees how many will go on to play the senior World Cup that happens once in four years. \"You dont get many opportunities to play World Cups, obviously at the top level - it is once every four years, if you are fortunate enough to be involved. \"So the opportunity to play at the age-group level is a very exciting opportunity and one that should be enjoyed.\"','SPORTS-CRICKET','','2017-12-23 17:06:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 17:06 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(940,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/wrestling/pwl-auctions-sushil-kumar-picked-for-rs-55-lakh-by-sultans/articleshow/62225099.cms','PWL auctions: Sushil Kumar picked for Rs 55 lakh by Sultans','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62225112,width-400,resizemode-4/62225112.jpg]','NEW DELHI: Double Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar was picked for a whopping Rs 55 lakh during Pro Wrestling League auctions, on Saturday.

The former Ireland and Spurs player injected life into the game with a spectacular finish in the 78th minute to score his first goal of the season. This was ATKs second win from six matches as they climbed to seventh position in the league table with eight points. After being routed by Pune 1-4 in their first home appearance of 2017, this was ATKs first home win of the season. Keane, the Player of the Match, celebrated it with a double somersault and gestured with folded hands towards their gallery where co-owner Sourav Ganguly was cheering the side. An innocuous move from the Conor Thomas saw Bipin Singh create that perfect opportunity for the Irish man by heading down a long ball from the centre of the pitch. Having seen his assists missed by his teammates, the 37- year-old calmly received the ball, turned around to deceive the Delhi duo of captain Pritam Kotal and Rowilson Rodrigues, before a clinical finish handed Delhi their fifth straight defeat. ATK were a better side in the first-half and had the better share of chances but missed to score at least half a dozen chances. The BEST among them was by Zequinha, who missed a sitter after clearing two defenders with a brilliant run from the midfield. The Portuguese midfielder entered the box from the wide left and aimed at the far post but his right-footer went wide. Their star Irish captain Keane looked in his element and set it up brilliantly from left as well as right flanks but none of them were converted. The first Chance came as early as the fifth minute when Keane set it up from the left with a beautiful cross but Jayesh Ranes header was wayward. Rane, who started from the bench in their win at Mumbai City FC in the last round, was for the first time named in the starting XI but only to let go a glorious opportunity. Rane further missed out another opportunity in the 58th minute as ATK were headed for a third draw of the season. In the 50th minute, Rane forwarded a quality ball for their captain Keane, who attempted a shot at goal but goalkeeper Arnab Das Sharma pulled of a good save to deny him from scoring his maiden ISL goal. In the 69th minute, Ryan Taylor struck a splendid corner that curled in but Thomas header found the roof of the net as ATK were still looking for that elusive goal before the Keane magic. Romeo Fernandes was the most impressive for Delhi and created opportunities from the right flank but they paled in comparison.','SPORTS-FOOTBALL','','2017-12-23 22:38:00','PTI | Dec 23, 2017, 22:38 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(943,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-south-africa/kedar-shardul-back-for-sa-odis-kl-rahul-misses-out/articleshow/62223648.cms','Kedar, Shardul back for SA ODIs, KL Rahul misses out','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62223655,width-400,resizemode-4/62223655.jpg]','MUMBAI: Middle-order batsman Kedar Jadhav and speedster Shardul Thakur were back in the 17-member India squad for the six-match ODI series in South Africa but KL Rahul failed to make the cut despite back-to-back half-centuries in the T20 series against Sri Lanka. Senior spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja were once again ignored by the selectors, who backed the young trio of slow bowlers - wrist spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav along with left-arm spinner Axar Patel. Chairman of selectors MSK Prasad made it clear that they are looking to give Yadav and Chahal a longer rope since they had decided to look at wrist spinners after the Champions Trophy. \"We keep on repeating that after Champions Trophy, we tried with the new boys - Chahal and Kuldeep - and we are being consistent with Axar,\" Prasad said after the selection meeting here. \"With the big games, they are definitely improving a lot and we all felt and its a unanimous decision that they should be given an extended role, since they are doing well. They should be backed,\" he added. \"We want to increase the bench-strength in the spin department and today all of us will accept that we have five-six quality spinners.\" Senior pacer Mohammed Shami made a comeback in the ODI team while Shardul came back in place of Siddarth Kaul, who was in the squad for the three-match series against Sri Lanka. Prasad indicated that from the England series next summer, they will close in on the core ODI team for the 2019 World Cup. \"Probably from the England series, thats where we will have a core team, and may be we fix up on a certain number and focus from there on.\" One of the players who was unfortunate to miss out was Rahul, who has played two dazzling knocks in the two T20s against Sri Lanka. But with Shikhar Dhawan and vice-captain Rohit Sharma being automatic choices and Ajinkya Rahane being specifically looked as an opener in the 50-over version, there was no place for Rahul as the fourth opener. Shreyas Iyer is being looked as a possible batsman for the number four slot. \"We are discussing Rahuls batting position. Because the class and the form that he is in, it is really unfortunate that (he) is missing out. \"Right now those boys who are there in the squad have done well and it makes sense to continue with them. May be in times to come, KL will definitely get a look-in. We will try and see different options. Probably after this series, we have to think about that,\" Prasad said. He also informed that the T20 squad will be a separate one and they are moving towards a direction where the three formats will have their own specialists. Squad: Virat Kohli (Captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni (wk), Dinesh Karthik, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Axar Patel, Shardul Thakur, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar.','SPORTS-CRICKET','','2017-12-23 21:39:00','PTI | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 21:39 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(944,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/sri-lanka-in-india/formidable-india-eye-whitewash-against-sri-lanka-in-third-t20i/articleshow/62218435.cms','Formidable India eye whitewash against Sri Lanka in third T20I','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62218630,width-400,resizemode-4/62218630.jpg]','MUMBAI: With the series already in their pocket, India will look to give some of the bench players a chance but there will be no let-up in the intensity as they eye a complete whitewash against Sri Lanka in the third and final T20I on Sunday.

ALSO READ: Rohits joint fastest T20 ton sinks Sri Lanka While the hosts thrashed Sri Lanka by 93 runs in the first match at Cuttack, they outclassed them by 88 runs in Indore to seal the series. The visitors also lost the ODIs 1-2 and drew a blank in the Test series held earlier. On the other hand, India have been cruising across all formats and would surely look to end a successful year with another thumping win ahead of a tough tour of South Africa where they play three Tests, six ODIs and three T20s. The constant one-sided results may not be an ideal preparation for India for the upcoming tour, but the positive thing is that in absence of seniors including inspirational captain Virat Kohli, the youngsters have taken responsibility and delivered in the T20s and ODIs. Stand-in skipper Rohit Sharma, who equalled David Millers record of the fastest ever T20 century during his 43 -ball 118-run innings in Indore, is in peak form and he would love to continue his good run at his home ground. Be it K L Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey or the experienced campaigner Mahendra Singh Dhoni -- all have chipped in when needed and coach Ravi Shastri would expect them to fire big time tomorrow. Especially Rahul, who already has two fifties to his credit, would surely want to add one more to his kitty and make a strong statement before the teams upcoming tour. Iyer, the local boy, scored in the opening game, but he needs to stay at the wicket and convert his starts to big knocks. India has promoted Dhoni up the order yesterday and the former captain justified the teams decision by scoring at a brisk pace. The same can be expected in Mumbai if the openers give a flying start. This Indian batting line up can destroy any bowling attack and Sri Lankas toothless bowlers just provide them more opportunity to be devastating and ruthless. The credit for preparing good bench strength should be given to the Indian Premier League and the robust domestic circuit. Wrist spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav, who starred last night too, have cemented their place by picking up regular wickets after their international debuts. The selectors would be seeing how Saurashtra pacer Jaydev Unadkat performs, as he can be an important cog in the scheme of things after veteran pacer Ashish Nehra called it a day. Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah have already cemented their place in the team and a good game for them will boost their confidence ahead of a gruelling tour. But having won the series, the team management may decide to play some young guns like Basil Thampi, Washington Sundar and Deepak Hooda. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka have been dealt a severe blow with Angelo Mathews being ruled out of the match due to a hamstring injury. In his absence, senior pros like Upul Tharanga will have to take responsibility and deliver. Kusal Pereras 37-ball 77 in the second T20I gave a huge boost to the team and he would look for another good innings tomorrow. Their bowlers too have failed to put up a spirited show and skipper Thisara Perera would like his men to at-least give a fight and reverse the trend. All bowlers including Nuwan Pradeep, Mathews and Thisara himself have leaked plenty of runs and they need to pull their socks to stop the Indian Juggernaut and come up with something special. Overall the Wankhede wicket has favored the batsmen in the past but scores as high as 190 have been chased in T20 games here. Considering the form of Indian batsmen spectators can see another run-feast tomorrow. Squads: India: Rohit Sharma (C), K L Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Dinesh Karthik, MS Dhoni, Hardik Pandya, Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Deepak Hooda, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Siraj, Basil Thampi and Jaydev Unadkat.

Pep Guardiolas team are ripping up the record books this season and Bournemouth had no answer to their all-round dominance on an afternoon when hard work rather than flair was the key to success. The runaway league leaders again showed they are simply too good this season and in the process became the first side since Liverpool in 1982 to score 100 English top-flight goals in a calendar year. Bournemouth dropped into the relegation zone, but could console themselves that of the 19 teams City have faced in the league this term, only Everton have managed to avoid defeat. The visitors cause was not helped by the absence of England international Jermain Defoe, who limped out of their mid-week loss to Chelsea, and Harry Arter, was also absent with calf trouble. Vincent Kompany returned to Citys starting line-up for the first time since injuring himself against Manchester United on December 10 and that gave the already confident home side a further boost. Bournemouths slender hopes of success at the Etihad Stadium received a further blow after 12 minutes when Junior Stanislas pulled up following a shot at goal and had to go off with an apparent hamstring complaint. City then turned up the tempo as Aguero chipped over when well placed before visiting goalkeeper Asmir Begovic brilliantly blocked a long-range strike from Nicolas Otamendi. Eddie Howes Bournemouth played with a 5-4-1 formation when not on the ball, but they then had no defensive answer after 27 minutes when Aguero nodded home the opener to score his 100th goal at the Etihad. City pressed Bournemouth hard, Fernandinho delivered a fine curling cross and Aguero did the rest, diving to head past the onrushing Begovic. To Bournemouths credit, the goal did not open the floodgates immediately and they remained fast and feisty, but the gulf of quality between the two sides was more than apparent. After the interval, a wonderful last-gasp Steve Cook challenge prevented David Silva from sweeping home from six yards out as City flew out of the blocks. Shortly after Cooks intervention, City claimed their second when Sterling finished a fine move by thrashing a low effort past Begovic following a through ball from Aguero. The goal capped off a difficult week for the England international, who on Wednesday saw a man jailed for 16 weeks for racially abusing and attacking him prior to last weekends 4-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur. Bournemouth visibly wilted after Sterlings intervention and City began to camp out in the oppositions third. Aguero made it 3-0 after 79 minutes when he beat Begovic with a header from six yards out and Danilo added further sheen to the scoreline as he slotted home from 10 yards out with five minutes remaining.','SPORTS-FOOTBALL','','2017-12-23 23:00:00','AFP | Dec 23, 2017, 23:00 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(946,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/snooker/billiards/pankaj-advani-amee-kamani-defend-national-6-red-titles-in-style/articleshow/62224225.cms','Pankaj Advani, Amee Kamani defend National 6-Red titles in style','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62224224,width-400,resizemode-4/62224224.jpg]','CHENNAI: Multiple-time world champion Pankaj Advani overcame a few anxious moments to defend his national 6-red snooker title by defeating Kamal Chawla 7-3 (0-65(65), 66-5, 0-66(45), 40-9, 71-0, 1-50, 42-37, 70(70)-0, 41(41)-1, 49-14) in the final on Saturday.

The decision had received the green signal from the cabinet earlier this week, and the official notification for the same was released on Friday, confirmed minister for social justice and welfare Arun Chaturvedi. \"These communities were identified as the most backward by the OBC Commission and on the basis of the commissions report, the community has been now given 1% additional reservation under the more backward classes. Along with this 1%, they will continue to receive quota benefits under the OBC quota,\" said Chaturvedi. While the state government might be hoping to have solved a long-pending issue, the Gujjars, which form about 6% of the total population, are not happy. \"What the government has done is not acceptable to us. We stand on our 5% demand and will continue to fight for it,\" said Col Kirorilal Bainsla, convener of the Gujjar Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti. The state government has been unable to fulfill its promise of 5% quota for the five communities as that would take the overall quota in the state to 54%. The governments attempts to raise the overall quota over the celling of 50% have been repeatedly struck down by the courts. \"Most people in the Gujjar camp are well aware that it would not be easy to push the overall quota limit. They are ready for whatever they get. Now, they can continue to avail the 2-3% they receive under the 21% OBC quota and an additional 1% as the most backward,\" said a senior official. Govt will support demand : Rathore State parliamentary affairs minister Rajendra Rathore said that the government has not stopped trying to provide the five communities 5% dedicated quota as promised. \"We have filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking to increase reservation quota for the OBC from 21% to 26%. If the SC allows us to raise the overall quota in the state, Gujjars along with four other communities will be provided the assured 5% reservation in government jobs and educational institutes under a sub-category within the OBC,\" said Rathore. The idea of the additional 1% quota was already rejected by the Gujjar delegation, which participated in talks with the state government, recently, after the high court struck down the governments move to raise the OBC quota. However, the state government and the ruling party, which is facing bypolls in Lok Sabha constituencies of Alwar and Ajmer along with the assembly seat of Mandalgarh in Bhilwara, is keen to pacify the Gujjar community to prevent any backlash.','CITY-JAIPUR','','2017-12-23 08:37:00','TNN | Updated: Dec 23, 2017, 08:37 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:03'),(949,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/army-chief-witnesses-firepower-at-hamesha-vijayee-war-exercise/articleshow/62217544.cms','Army chief witnesses firepower at Hamesha Vijayee war exercise','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62217556,width-400,resizemode-4/62217556.jpg]','JAISALMER: The Army along with Indian Air Force (IAF) demonstrated their firing power capability in exercise Hamesha Vijayee at the Thar Desert here on Friday.

In a complaint filed before the cyber police station in Jaipur, the complainant claimed that on November 2016, a foreign woman named Rebecca Chirstine contacted her on a social media platform and expressed her desire to donate her property worth 3.9 million dollars to her. \"The conmen introduced herself as a rich philanthropist battling cancer. She offered to donate her property to the woman in Sawai Madhopur for social service and other nobel cause such as beti bacho and beti padhao,\" said deputy SP, cyber police station, Suresh Kumar.

But one Rajasthan MLA is satisfied his son has landed a government job as a peon at the state assembly. Ram Kishan, the son of Jagdish Narayan Meena, sitting BJP MLA from Jamwa Ramgarh, is one of 18 people selected from 18,008 candidates for a Grade IV vacancy, said state assembly sources. The selections were made on the basis of interviews by a selection board but the MLAs sons case has led to demands for an investigation of the selection process. Meena belongs to the ST category. Rajasthan Pradesh Congress president Sachin Pilot said a high-level inquiry should be held. The BJP government, which had promised the youth 15 lakh jobs, was now using nepotism in the few thousand jobs it had created, Pilot alleged. There were similar complaints of nepotism during the selection of \"gram sevaks\". He said it was alleged that BJP leaders relatives had been selected as \"gram sevaks\" in place of \"Vidhyarthi Mitras\". Meena, a first-time BJP MLA, said his eldest son, Ram Kishan, had applied for the job after the assembly secretariat had advertised for the post. \"My son is only Metric (sic). Since Ram Kishan is the eldest of four siblings, he had to take care of the farms and his younger siblings. So he could study only up to Matriculation (sic),\" said the MLA. He said that his son had been selected through the routine selection process and that there was nothing unusual in his getting the job. When asked why he had not taken the opportunity to launch his son in politics, as other politicians do, Meena said politics was not everybodys cup of tea. This is the second time an MLAs son has applied for a Grade IV job in government. Earlier, BJP legislator Heera Lal Vermas son Hansraj, who had studied till Class 8, had appeared for an interview at Ajmers Krishi Upaj Mandi (Rajasthan State Agriculture Marketing Board) in 2015. A two-time MLA from Tonk district, Verma, who was a state government officer before joining politics, had said then that his son was \"less educated\" and, therefore, eligible only for a Grade IV job.

Woman also said that in the fear of society and defamation she did not tell about it to the police,\" said a senior officer of Rajsamand police who interrogated the accused. Police said that since the family of the girl was also planning to lodge an FIR against him and take some legal action, the hate killer thought if any case would be registered against him it would defame him in front of his own family having wife and parents. \"He was into illicit relation with a girl in the town for more than 10 months.

On Wednesday, in an open letter, Joshi sought information from the university within 48 hours to provide a copy of notification from AICTE if at all the apex body has granted any relaxation in eligibility criteria. Also, Joshi has sought details of research papers and books published by Vyas. \"After I moved my complaint before Gujarat governor, who is also visitor at MSU, it is argued that VC got the dual professorship at FMS on the basis of 128 research papers, nine books and nine awards. If university administration believes in transparency, it should provide notification if at all there is any whereby AICTE has relaxed its norms and a candidate is selected on the basis of research papers, books or awards,\" said Joshi, adding that AICTE criteria clearly states that a candidate should have first class at post-graduate level. Although Vyas refused to comment on allegations levelled by Joshi, sources in the university suggest that the dual professorship conferred to Vyas is not a position by appointment but a status conferred by the university. The dual or joint professorship to Vyas, a professor at Faculty of Commerce, was granted during the tenure of MSUs former vice-chancellor professor Yogesh Singh. \"As per the requirement for conferring the joint professorship status, a professor with five years teaching and research experience after joining as full time professor can be considered for the status,\" said an official. Vyas had joined as professor at commerce in May 2004 and he was given the status as joint professor in July-August 2014. \"Similar, as per the norms, a professor with academic performance index (API) score of not less than 400 points in category three after joining as full professor can be considered for conferring the joint professor status.

She writes fluently, using simple language, and its easy to see how she has built up an enormous following, being described as 100 most influential celebrities in India by Forbes. The story of this book spins out in rural Kerala where young Ayan is sent on his fathers orders to keep his cantankerous grandfather company, having just lost his job. We gradually find out that the real reason for which Ayans father, Jairaj, does this is so he can move his father out of the ancestral home in order to sell it for a tidy sum. What the domineering Jairaj does not bargain for, however, is that his son turns out to have a great deal more heart than he has and is also slowly developing a backbone that will help him stand up to his father when the time is right. As Ayans relationship with Gopal Shankar, his grandfather, develops, he begins to reassess his own priorities towards his career, friendships and relationships. The biggest lesson he learns is that true love, when it comes, is lifes most precious commodity and one not to be trifled with. Shenoy develops these two characters beautifully, making both of men completely credible. Gopal Shankar, in particular, is the elderly relative all of us have in our families - grouchy and opinionated but, in this case, we are treated to a wonderful back story that explains exactly why this is the case. This book is partially the story of elder abuse, an increasingly urgent one, not just in India but even in developed countries and one cannot help but cheer a nice young man like Ayan who refuses to stand by and allow such a travesty to happen. The other, more meditative, sub-plot of lost love is equally moving and I wish to commend Shenoy for daring to explore the realm of love between older people and societys usual scorn and revulsion towards such a prospect.

A swirl of blush could have made her glow and also highlighted her cheeks in the right way. It would have made her face look more bright! As the outfit was a muted beige colour, she should have gone for a little colour on her lips too. The nude gloss didnt do justice at all!

Unfortunately, my fathers is having an affair with a married woman who has two kids for the past two years. His behaviour towards us (my mother and I) has changed drastically. He considers us a burden and has started neglecting us. We always see him chatting with her, sending her messages and talking with her for long hours. There is no doubt that they might be having a physical relationship as well. This entire situation has become a torture for us. Please advise what should I do?— By Anonymous Response by Rachana Awatramani : I understand that you are in a difficult situation as your fathers behaviour towards you and your mother has changed because he is having an affair with a married woman. Firstly, I appreciate that you have shared your concerns here and I know that you want to make the situation at home better as it was before like a happy family. Though it may be difficult on many levels for you to deal with this situation, I would request you to respect and stay out of your parents marriage concerns. Its in everyones best interest—including yours. Although it is their concern, I am sure you are not immune to its impact as well. But the fact is that this is a relationship problem between them (two grown up individuals) and they need to resolve it. Your father might be expecting something from the relationship which he is not getting, and similarly your mother might be having certain expectations. This situation can be better handled between them through communication and they need to figure out what has changed and things that need to be worked on. They can consider for marriage counselling also. Depending on the situation, I would suggest that you can speak to your father and ask him what is it that has caused this behaviour change and how it can be improved and you can express your feelings and emotions of feeling neglected and tortured by him. You can tell him that you miss how you were a happy family. A relationship is a big investment of time, emotions, feelings and finances. It is also an investment which is done by both partners. And when someone has spent a lot of time in one relationship, sometimes it becomes monotonous and then a partner seeks for change and excitement from outside. Such incidents then become emotionally painful for the other partner. As I said earlier, relationship is an investment and its not onetime investment, its a continuous investment which has to be done by both of them and not one, therefore if you are unable to speak to your father you can speak to your mother. Your parents have to communicate and decide on how they want to take this relationship forward. It is an emotionally difficult situation for you, therefore I would suggest a few tips that can help you cope better: first, speak to a friend or a sibling about the situation, you can also meet a counsellor. Next, you can express your feelings and emotions to your parents if the situation permits. You can maintain a dairy to express your thoughts. Try and build a separate relationship with each of your parent, and focus on your life rather than trying to solve their problems. -Ms Rachana Awatramani is a Counselling Psychologist in Mumbai Want expert advice for your relationship?

While coral reefs are under threat due to rising temperatures and human impact, scuba divers around the world love to dive and look for coral reefs because they hold rich marine life in and around them, providing a melange of colours.','CITY-HYDERABAD','Neeshita Nyayapati','2017-12-19 06:00:00','| TNN | Dec 19, 2017, 06:00 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:04'),(977,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/no-sunny-for-bengaluru/articleshow/62176768.cms','No Sunny for Bengaluru','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62178195,width-400,resizemode-4/62178195.jpg]','There is no denying that Sunny Leone is immensely popular, and not only because of her former adult star status, but as a Bollywood star, who has also made her mark in Sandalwood with two special numbers, Kamakshi (Luv U Alia) and Sesamma (DK). This is exactly what the Bengaluru-based event firm was tapping into when Sunny was listed as the performer for the New Year bash at a north Bengaluru venue. Huge hoardings announcing the event have been dotting the city scape. But with just days to go for the show, it appears to have been derailed, after members of the fringe group, Karnataka Rakshana Vedike Yuva Sene, opposed it. The Vedike members stated that her performance would be against \"our culture\" and threatened to commit mass suicide lest she goes ahead with the show. Bowing to pressure from the protesters, the government has refused approval to conduct the event. \"We have denied permission fearing law and order problems in the wake of protests by pro-Kannada outfits and keeping in view the directions of the Karnataka High Court in a molestation case reported on MG Road last New Years Eve,\" Home Minister R Ramalinga Reddy was quoted as saying. No Sunny, no event: Organizer Harish Mysore, MD of the firm, is awaiting the ruling in the petition he has filed in the Karnataka High Court in this regard today. \"As of now, Sunny has now said that due to the failure of providing police security in Bengaluru, in the interest of guests, she will not come,\" he says. Harish adds, \"We are waiting the court order today and, if it is in our favour, we will attempt to convince her to perform at our event. This is my first event and I have invested my own money into it. If the show doesnt go ahead, I will also have to cancel it altogether and suffer huge losses,\" he says and adds, \"I am a Kannadiga, my culture is not such that it will be spoilt by Sunny Leone performing for half an hour. We have to look beyond the fact that she used to be an adult star. She is an accepted artiste in Bollywood and several other film industries, including Sandalwood. She was scheduled to have three entries during the entire show, one to her Bollywood numbers, another to her Kannada songs and finally, for the New Year countdown.\" In the aftermath of the opposition, Harish claims that he has been trying to meet Ramalinga Reddy to sort out the issue. \"I was finally told by his secretary that I should speak to the Commissioner of Police, which I have been unable to do so far, as I have not got an appointment. I did, however, speak to the jurisdictional DCP Girish S, who gave me a notice with some 18-19 queries regarding the event and all the permissions. Herein lies the issue. Like all event organizers, I applied for necessary permissions as early as December 1, and then went ahead with booking artistes. Normally, your paperwork comes through in the week before the event and the process is such that you get all clearances only after the police gives you an OK. Now, if they refuse to give us permission, how can they expect us to have clearance from Excise, BBMP, PWD and all other departments? I will respond to the notice, but I also await the court order,\" he says. Permission has been rejected: DCP Girish S, DCP - North East, Bengaluru City Police, says, \"This event has been verbally rejected. However, we have asked for clarifications from the organizers, based on information that is missing from their application. The organizers havent responded yet, including about how many tickets they plan to sell, names of the other performing celebrities, permissions from BBMP and PWD, whether they have ambulance and fire services in place, etc. They have stated that they have massive parking space around the arena, which we are unsure about. The fact that they have someone like Sunny Leone as the main act means that they need a lot of security. It is New Years Eve and we have revelry everywhere. We cannot deploy extra policemen at the venue. In fact, cops from my jurisdiction will man the Brigade Road-MG Road area in the wake of last years incident. If the organizers decide to not bring Sunny to the event, we might consider giving them permissions if the rest of the clarifications are answered.\" No issues with other New year events: Event managers Richard Mathew, an event organizer in Bengaluru, says that this episode is an exception to Bengalurus otherwise welcoming spirit. \"Weve had a lot of international DJs, which include women, come down for events, including for New Years Eve bashes. The only question asked is whether they have all the right visa formalities in place and if we are following all the legalities. We also ensure we never hurt anyones sentiments in these events. But, all said, Sunny Leone is a celebrity at a different level. Though, she was coming to the city just as a performer. Maybe, it was a hasty decision, since she was to dance to a Kannada number at the event. Bengaluru is traditionally a welcoming venue and we have encouraged every artiste or concept, sometimes even before the rest of the country experiences it. We need to remember this,\" says Richard. Will Brand Bengaluru take a hit? Oum Pradutt, another event organizer, says that the cancellation of the Sunny Leone event will not really affect the brand value of the city. \"I dont think Brand Bengaluru will be affected. This is just an event that some individuals have expressed their concern about. She, in fact, is just another artiste who was supposed to perform at an event, which is like any other show. Celebrities keep travelling for such events across the globe to perform and this is one of those. The brand value of the city will not be affected. It will only ensure that people will remain in the news for a while, like the artiste concerned and the protesters,\" says Oum. Brand strategy specialist Harish Bijoor, however, begs to differ. \"I appreciate the fact that Bengaluru Police has not given permission to the event in the backdrop of what happened last year. Any police department will be on the back foot, because their mandate is to help people usher in New Year peacefully. But when we look at how this impacts Brand Bengaluru, we have to remember that this is a progressive, all-embracing city. When an artiste is not allowed to perform for who he/she is, it affects this progressive avatar. Sunny Leone comes with baggage of the past and eminent talent of the present. We are almost at the cusp of 2018, and we cannot be judging artistes based on this baggage of the past. That is not progressive; it is regressive. My belief is that Bengaluru offers the most secular environment for progressive writers and artistes and while we dont want the tag of city of gropers, as we did after NY 2017, we cannot be seen as regressive either,\" he says.','CITY-BENGALURU','Prathibha Joy and Sunayana Suresh','2017-12-21 00:00:00','| TNN | Dec 21, 2017, 00:00 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:04'),(978,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/santa-claus-comes-to-town-riding-an-elephant-in-thailand/articleshow/62206791.cms','Santa Claus comes to town riding an elephant in Thailand','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62206910,width-400,resizemode-4/62206910.jpg]','BANGKOK: A troupe of elephants bearing presents visited students in Thailands old capital of Ayutthaya on Friday to spread Christmas cheer.

The foreign secretaries of Bangladesh and Myanmar met in Dhaka to finalise the agreement signed on November 23 for the voluntary return of nearly three-quarters of a million stateless Rohingya living in refugee camps along the border. A new working group would \"ensure commencement of repatriation within two months\" by developing a timetable for the verification of refugee identities and logistics of their return, Bangladeshs foreign ministry said in a statement. \"Now, we will start the next step of our work,\" Bangladesh foreign minister A.H. Mahmood Ali told reporters after the meeting. But there is growing doubt that the persecuted minority will be safe if returned to Rakhine state, where Doctors Without Borders said nearly 7,000 Rohingya were killed in a month of violence. An estimated 655,000 refugees from the stateless group have poured across the border into Bangladesh since August, fleeing what the US and United Nations have described as ethnic cleansing. UN rights chief Zeid Raad Al Hussein said he had received no assurances that international observers would be allowed into northern Rakhine to monitor the return of the Rohingya. \"We have seen no interest or desire to invite my office in. So we are sceptical of that,\" he told AFP in an interview Monday. Human Rights Watch on Monday, citing analysis of satellite imagery, said Myanmars army burned down dozens of Rohingya homes within days of the signing of the repatriation deal. The watchdog said the repatriation deal was \"a public relations stunt\" and warned the Rohingya would not be safe in Rakhine without guarantees of equal rights and protections. The Rohingya have been the target of past pogroms in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, which does not recognise the group as a genuine ethnicity and has stripped them of citizenship. Testimonies gathered by AFP from displaced Rohingya in Bangladesh suggest few refugees wish to return to Myanmar, where many saw their villages burned to ashes and loved ones killed. \"We will not go back to our country until our rights are afforded,\" said Rohingya refugee Roushan Ali from a camp in Bangladeshs southeast. \"We want full citizenship and the return of our land and property. We also want justice for our people who were slaughtered, tortured and raped.\" British charity Oxfam said in a new report Tuesday that many Rohingya were terrified of returning and unwilling to consider it without guarantees of safety. Conditions remain bleak in Bangladeshs displacement camps, with an outbreak of diphtheria having killed 19 refugees so far, the International Organization for Migration said on Tuesday. Myanmars leader Aung San Suu Kyi has said major security operations against Rohingya militants stopped in early September. Responding to international pressure, Suu Kyis civilian government signed an agreement with Bangladesh to start the repatriation of the stateless Muslim refugees within two months. The agreement promises the \"safe and voluntary return\" of displaced Rohingya in Bangladesh -- not just the latest 655,000 new arrivals but more than 70,000 from a separate influx in October 2016. In a joint statement onTuesday after a meeting in Colombo, the leaders of Sri Lanka and Malaysia -- the latter home to a sizeable Rohingya diaspora -- called for the repatriation process to be \"undertaken expeditiously\". Aid groups have warned Myanmar they would boycott any new camps for Rohingya returnees, saying refugees must be allowed to settle in their own homes and not forced into ghetto-like conditions.','WORLD-SOUTH-ASIA','','2017-12-19 18:57:00','AFP | Dec 19, 2017, 18:57 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:04'),(980,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/indonesia-holds-cabinet-meeting-in-bali-as-volcano-threatens-tourism/articleshow/62204125.cms','Indonesia holds cabinet meeting in Bali as volcano threatens tourism','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62205377,width-400,resizemode-4/62205377.jpg]','JAKARTA: Indonesian President Joko Widodo will hold his cabinet meeting on Friday in a bid to reassure visitors that there is nothing to worry about from the rumbling Mount Agung volcano in the holiday island of Bali. Authorities last month raised the alert status of Mount Agung in northeastern Bali to the highest level, imposing an exclusion zone of up to 10 km (6 miles) around its crater as it spewed clouds of ash, steam, and other volcanic material. Widodo will take the unusual step of gathering his cabinet in Bali as part of government efforts to assure visitors that the island is safe to come to and to stave off a major drop off in visitor numbers during the upcoming holiday season. \"For those who have plans to vacation in Bali, theres no need to doubt or be worried about the status of Mount Agung, Bali is very safe to visit,\" Energy Minister Ignasius Jonan said in a Twitter message after visiting an observatory overlooking the volcano, before the cabinet meeting. President Widodo is expected to make a statement after the cabinet meeting. The cabinet usually meets at the state palace in the capital Jakarta or on its outskirts in Bogor. The relatively small island of Bali, famous for its beaches and temples, has an outsized importance for Indonesian tourism. In January-September, Bali received 4.5 million foreign tourist arrivals, nearly half of the 10.5 million arrivals in Indonesia. Tourism Minister Arief Yahya said this week that Indonesia was expecting an estimated 15 trillion rupiah ($1.11 billion) in lost income and around 1 million fewer tourists because of the volcano, according to daily newspaper Kompas. Many business operators and hotels have seen cancellations since authorities first raised the alert in September, and most expect the holiday season to be slower than in previous years. Thousands of tourists were left stranded late last month when a volcanic ash cloud forced the closure of Balis airport for several days. Countries like Australia and Singapore have advised their citizens to be cautious when travelling to Bali.','WORLD-SOUTH-ASIA','','2017-12-22 12:24:00','Reuters | Updated: Dec 22, 2017, 12:24 IST','2017-12-23 19:22:04'),(981,'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/myanmar-planned-rohingya-attacks-possibly-genocide-un-rights-chief/articleshow/62124743.cms','Myanmar planned Rohingya attacks, possibly genocide: UN rights chief','[https://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-62124742,width-400,resizemode-4/62124742.jpg]','GENEVA: The UN rights chief told AFP Monday that Myanmar had clearly \"planned\" the violent attacks on its Rohingya minority, causing a mass-exodus, and warned the crackdown could possibly amount to \"genocide\". \"For us, it was clear... that these operations were organised and planned,\" he said in an interview on the crackdown estimated to have killed thousands and forced more than 655,000 Rohingya to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh since August. \"You couldnt exclude the possibility of acts of genocide...

Several societies in Ghaziabad have put up signboards with messages to sensitize pet owners to clean the common area if their dogs litter when out for a walk. If your dog poops, you must scoop even if no one sees you, says one of the boards. Alok Kumar, President, AOA Ghaziabad, says, \"Some owners dont look after their dogs who litter. Earlier, dogs would poop in the lift and residents would fight over whose dog has done it and who should clean. Sometimes, things escalated so much that we had to consider taking polices help to resolve the matter. So we thought of putting up boards so that logon ko thoda samajh aaye. The purpose of starting this was to create awareness among people. There are certain fines as well if they dont follow rules, like some societies impose a fine of Rs100-Rs150 in case anyones dog litters.\" Such boards have also been put up in Arihant Harmony society (BCCL/ Samik Sen) It was started around 20 days ago at Niho Scottish Garden Society and was followed by several other apartments.
